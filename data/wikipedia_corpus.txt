Henry Hugh Bancroft (29 February 1904 – 11 September 1988) was a British organist , choirmaster, and composer who was organist of five cathedrals. He was born in Cleethorpes , Lincolnshire , and studied music with E. P. Guthrie and J. S. Robinson in nearby Grimsby .

He attained the FRCO diploma in 1925. He was then organist of Old Clee parish church and was supplementing his modest income by playing in the local theatre and by working as a compass adjuster. Seeking better prospects, he left for Canada in 1929 to become organist of St. Matthew's Anglican Church in Winnipeg, Manitoba . In 1936 while at St. Matthew's, he earned an external BMus from Durham University . After nine years, he left for the Church of the Ascension in Hamilton, Ontario , but stayed there only nine months.

In 1937, he was back in Winnipeg, at the downtown parish of All Saints, where he developed a men and boys choir of national renown and initiated choral evensongs on the model of the Church of England cathedrals. Also in Winnipeg, he met and married his wife Eldred Curle.

From 1946 to 1948 he was organist of Christ Church Cathedral in Vancouver, British Columbia, director of the Vancouver Bach Choir, and an instructor at the British Columbia Institute of Music and Drama. He left Vancouver to become master of music at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Sydney, Australia, but in 1953 returned to All Saints in Winnipeg.

On a visit to Cambridge University on his way back from Australia, he experienced the annual Advent Carol service of King's College , and the next year introduced the tradition to Canada at All Saints' Church.

He was briefly at Christ Church Cathedral in Nassau, Bahamas , before moving to All Saints' Cathedral in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1958, where he remained until his retirement in 1980. From 1968 to 1977 he also taught for the Department of Music of the University of Alberta in Edmonton.

Bancroft was also known as a teacher, and instructed many students who went on to have careers as composers and organists, including Hugh McLean (organist) , Barry Anderson, Barbara Pentland , Douglas Bodle,  Elwyn Davies and Herbert Sadler.

An active composer and arranger, Bancroft was an Associate Composer of the Canadian Music Centre and published numerous pieces, including anthems, motets, chorale and organ works. Several works were premiered by major symphony orchestras.

One Master (foaled 1 April 2014) is a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. She did not race until she was a three-year-old when she won two of her three races including the Listed October Stakes . In the following year she was beaten in her first three starts before taking the Group 3 Fairy Bridge Stakes in Ireland and the Group 1 Prix de la Forêt in France. As a five-year-old in 2019 she repeated her victory in the Prix de la Forêt as well as being placed in the Queen Anne Stakes , Falmouth Stakes and British Champions Sprint Stakes . In 2020 she won the Oak Tree Stakes and took the Prix de la Forêt for a record third time.

Background

One Master is a bay mare with no white markings bred in England by Roy and Gretchen Jackson's Pennsylvania-based Lael Stables. During her racing career she carried the green, blue and white colours of Lael Stable and was trained by William Haggas at Newmarket, Suffolk .

Her sire, the Australian stallion Fastnet Rock , was a sprinter whose victories included the Lightning Stakes and the Oakleigh Plate . He sired many leading horses including Shoals and Atlantic Jewel in the Southern hemisphere before moving to the Coolmore Stud in Ireland. His European progeny have included Fascinating Rock and Qualify . One Master's dam Enticing was a top class sprinting mare who won the King George Stakes as a four-year-old in 2008, and was a daughter of the 2000 Cartier Champion Two-year-old Filly Superstar Leo . Superstar Leo was in turn a granddaughter of Dancing Rocks, whose other descendants have included Power and Footstepsinthesand .

Racing career

2017: three-year-old season

One Master did not race as a two-year-old, making her racecourse debut on 19 August 2017 when she finished third in a maiden race over six furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse , beaten one and a half lengths by the winner Equitation. In September she was ridden by Ryan Moore when she started the 4/11 favourite for a similar event at Yarmouth Racecourse and recorded her first success as she took the lead a furlong from the finish and pulled away from her seven opponents to win by two and three quarter lengths. Martin Harley took the ride when the filly was stepped up to Listed class for the seven-furlong October Stakes at Ascot Racecourse on 7 October and started a 20/1 outsider in a thirteen-runner field. After being restrained at the rear of the field One Master began to make progress in the last quarter mile, overtook the front-running favourite Eternally a furlong out, and kept on well to win by one and a quarter lengths from Bletchley.

2018: four-year-old season

On her first start of 2018 One Master finished fourth after starting favourite for the Group 3 Chartwell Fillies' Stakes over seven furlongs at Lingfield Park on 12 May. In the following month she was sent to Ireland for the Ballyogan Stakes at the Curragh but was again the beaten favourite, taking third place behind Actress and Gorane. On 3 August at Goodwood Racecourse she was beaten again as she finished fourth behind the three-year-old Pretty Baby in the Oak Tree Stakes . At the end of the month the filly returned to Ireland for the Fairy Bridge Stakes over seven and a half furlongs at Tipperary Racecourse and started the 9/2 second favourite behind the Aidan O'Brien -trained I Can Fly. Ridden by Colm O'Donoghue she recorded her first win of the year as she produced a strong late run to take the lead in the closing stages and won by half a length from Dan's Dream. After the race O'Donoghue said "I spoke to James Doyle and Ryan Moore and they were very complimentary of the filly. They said to ride her cold as she’d finish off the race good and ground and trip wasn’t a problem. She hit the line strong".

On 7 October One Master was ridden by Pierre-Charles Boudot when she started a 33/1 outsider for the Group 1 Prix de la Forêt over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse . The Prix Maurice de Gheest winner Polydream started favourite, while the other thirteen runners included Teppal , Gustav Klimt ( Superlative Stakes ), Sir Dancealot ( Lennox Stakes ), Inns of Court ( Prix du Gros Chêne ) and James Garfield ( Mill Reef Stakes ). After being restrained towards the rear of the field, One Master produced a sustained run on the outside in the last 400 metres and caught the leader Inns of Court on the line to win by a short head, with Dutch Connection a head away in third. After the race William Haggas said "Pierre-Charles had to get her settled, which he did beautifully, and she picked up well. She's a lovely filly that wants soft ground... She's tough... Her owners have been fantastic... They send me everything they breed, and I'm absolutely thrilled. I trained this filly's mother and grandmother".

One Master had two more races in 2018. In November she was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Mile at Churchill Downs and finished fifth to Expert Eye , a length behind the winner after staying on well in the closing stages. In December she ended her campaign in the Hong Kong Mile at Sha Tin Racecourse , coming home eighth of the fourteen runners behind Beauty Generation .

2019: five-year-old season

One Master began her 2019 campaign by running fourth behind Beshaayir in the Lanwades Stud Stakes at the Curragh on 25 May. Starting a 20/1 outsider for the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot in June she took the lead a furlong out but was overtaken in the closing stages and came home third behind Lord Glitters and Beat The Bank. In the Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 12 July she produced a sustained run from the rear of the field but failed by a neck to overhaul the Michael Stoute -trained four-year-old Veracious . She was dropped back in distance for the Prix Maurice de Gheest over 1300 metres at Deauville Racecourse in August and came home fifth behind the three-year-old Advertise .

On 6 October One Master attempted to repeat her 2018 victory in the Prix de la Forêt and started the 3.4/1 second choice in the betting behind the five-year-old City Light, the winner of the Prix de Saint-Georges and the Prix du Pin . The other contenders included Sir Dancealot, Glorious Journey ( Hungerford Stakes ), Safe Journey ( John of Gaunt Stakes ), Waldpfad ( Hackwood Stakes ) and Hey Gaman ( Prix du Palais-Royal ). Ridden by Boudot, she settled towards the rear of the twelve runner field before edging left to the outside to make her challenge in the straight. She gained the advantage entering the last 200 metres and held off the sustained challenge of City Light to win by half a length with the pair finishing three and a half lengths clear of Speak In Colours in third place. Haggas commented "She's been a fantastic filly who runs well every time. She's lightly raced because there are very few races she can run in. She may stay in training. The owners keep telling me they're too old to breed horses so would like the fun... She has a particular trip. This is the only Group 1 over seven furlongs, and she's managed to win it twice. She needs softer ground, so she will go to Ascot for the British Champions Sprint Stakes in two weeks' time, and that will be it for the season".

As Haggas predicted, One Master ended her season in the British Champions Sprint Stakes on 19 October and started the 4/1 joint-favourite alongside Advertise. She produced a sustained late run after being denied a clear run approaching the final furlong but failed by a length to overhaul the 33/1 outsider Donjuan Triumphant .

2020: six-year-old season

The 2020 flat racing season in Britain was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and One Master did not return to the track until 20 June when she contested the Diamond Jubilee Stakes , run behind closed doors at Royal Ascot, and finished sixth, beaten three and a half lengths by the winner Hello Youmzain . Three weeks later she ran for the second time in the Falmouth Stakes and finished a close fourth behind Nazeef , Billesdon Brook and Terrebellum, running on strongly after being denied a clear run a furlong from the finish. On 31 July at Goodwood, One Master was dropped back to Group 3 class for the Oak Tree Stakes on good to firm ground and started the 6/4 favourite, with the best of her eleven opponents appearing to be Althiqa (Prix Amandine) and Breathtaking Look ( Sceptre Stakes ). Ridden for the first time by Tom Marquand , she had considerable trouble in running before squeezing through on the inside, catching the Irish three-year-old Valeria Messalina on the line and winning by a short head. Haggas said "I told Tom to stay on the inside and not worry about it and if he got out fantastic and if he didn't at least she wouldn't have a hard race. Thankfully, she managed to get out in the nick of time. I won't run her on fast ground again - she doesn't deserve that. She's been with us a long time and has basically kept her form because we've looked after her."

At York Racecourse in August One Master started 13/8 favourite for the Group 2 City of York Stakes but was beaten into second place by the seven-year-old gelding Safe Voyage. In the Park Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in September the mare finished second again, beaten a short-head by Wichita, a three-year-old colt from the Aidan O'Brien stable who had finished second in the 2000 Guineas . On 4 October, with Boudot in the saddle, One Master attempted to become the first horse to win the Prix de la Foret for a third time and started the 2.9/1 second favourite behind Earthlight . The other seven runners were Safe Voyage, Tropbeau ( Prix du Calvados ), Spinning Memories ( Prix du Palais-Royal ), Rubaiyat ( Gran Criterium ), Pretreville ( Prix Bertrand du Breuil ), Irska ( Prix de Lieurey ) and Toro Strike. Racing on her favoured heavy ground, One Master settled in mid-division before making a forward move in the straight. She overhauled the leader Earthlight inside the last 100 metres and won by a neck, with the fast-finishing Safe Voyage a short-head away in third place. After the race Haggas commented "We're really proud of her. She's a fantastic filly and she seems to come good over this track and trip. She's particularly good on soft ground and was given another brilliant ride by Pierre-Charles. She wants to win... if you look after them when they're young, they'll look after you when they're older." Boudot said "I love her. When I asked her, she was very strong in the last furlong".

On 17 October One Master made her second attempt to win the British Champions Sprint Stakes on 17 October and finished a close third behind Glen Shiel and Brando after staying on strongly in the closing stages. She was then sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Mile but was withdrawn from the race after being found to have "raised muscle enzymes".

On 18 November it was announced that One Master had been retired from racing. Haggas commented "One Master has been an absolute star for us. She was kept in training specifically to win the Foret for a third time and it came off, which seldom happens."

Breeding record

After her retirement from racing One Master became a broodmare at the New England Stud in Newmarket. She was scheduled to be covered by Dubawi in 2021.

The Songrim Line is a partially electrified standard-gauge secondary line of the Korean State Railway in South Hwanghae Province , North Korea , running from Hwangju on the P'yŏngbu Line to Songrim .

The line continues past Songrim Ch'ŏngnyŏn Station to the freight-only Songrim Hwamul Station and the Hwanghae Iron & Steel Complex .

History

Originally built by the Chosen Government Railway ( Sentetsu ) as the Kyŏmip'o Line (겸이포선, 兼二浦線), construction was completed in November 1905, and  revenue operations began on 1 April 1908. Changch'ŏlli Station was opened by Sentetsu on 5 December 1915. Originally built to serve the Mitsubishi Iron Foundry (called the Hwanghae Iron & Steel Complex since 1945), in 1920 there was one daily round-trip through train between P'yŏngyang and Kyŏmip'o, along with five daily round-trip local trains (second and third class only) between Hwangju and Kyŏmip'o.

After the defeat of Japan in the Pacific War and the subsequent partition of Korea , the entirety of the line, being north of the 38th parallel , was located in the Soviet zone of occupation; on 10 August 1946, the Provisional People's Committee for North Korea nationalised all railways within its jurisdiction, including the Songrim Line, and it has since been operated by the Korean State Railway .

Route

A yellow background in the "Distance" box indicates that section of the line is not electrified.

Frank Hunter (26 July 1858 – 11 October 1930) was a Scotland international rugby union player; and also a Scotland international cricketer.

Rugby Union career

Amateur career

Hunter went to Fettes College , and then studied at Edinburgh University .

He played rugby union for Edinburgh University .

The Athletic News of 8 February 1882 reported on the university match against Northumberland County: "Frank Hunter, who has been chosen to play against Ireland on Saturday week, was out, and, he was on the winning side, could not fail to do well. Hunter is one [of] the most erratic half-backs I ever saw, and, when cornered, occasionally loses his head. It is months, I must admit, since I saw him perform, and perhaps he has improved vastly in the interval, but that he is to International form is what I cannot get myself to believe. His antecedents are as fresh in my mind as those of the most modern crack half-back, and, consequently, I may be permitted to speak of his abilities with some little authority."

International career

One of the earliest Scottish players, he was capped once for Scotland in 1882 against Ireland .

His selection caused a stir:- although he had a good reputation in the past, others were in form; and he was a current member of the Scottish Rugby Union committee. This led to comments from the Athletic News of 1 February 1882: "But there is different story to be told of Frank Hunter, the other half-back. This University man was voted into the team because he had a past reputation. But have all old players not past reputations, and past reputations, too, of greater account than that Hunter. I have no desire to be unnecessarily heavy upon Hunter, for he is a gentleman for whom I have the profoundest respect, but I think when a team such as the Scotch Fifteen comes to be chosen, personal consideration and what is euphemistically termed past reputation should be cast aside altogether. Besides, Frank Hunter is a member of the Union Committee; and, if I am not mistaken, there is a rule which prohibits committee men playing in these big matches. A very bad precedent has been established, and the Union, it now exists, is entirely at fault."

Cricket career

He played cricket for the Edinburgh University side; and in 1880 he captained the side.

He was a notable bowler and after university played for The Grange club in Edinburgh.

He also played for the Scotland national cricket team .

Law career

He studied law at the University of Edinburgh .

He became a lawyer and was a Writer to the Signet.

His uncle was a solicitor and after graduating he entered his uncle's firm Hunter, Blair and Cowan solicitors; which later became the firm of E.A. & F. Hunter.

He became a Commissioner for the Earl of Ailsa.

Family

His parents were Alexander McLean Hunter (1821-1892) and Eliza Anna Bostock (1830-1902). Alexander was from Edinburgh; Eliza from Vaucluse in Tasmania. They married in Melbourne, Australia on 5 September 1850. They had 6 children, 3 boys and 3 girls.

He was sent to Scotland to be schooled; and he then stayed with his uncle Evan Allan Hunter in Newark Castle, Ayr.

Frank married Elizabeth Agnes Mein-Austin (1866-1929), a girl from St. Mungo in Dumfries in Scotland, in Williamstown, Victoria in Australia. They settled back in Scotland and had 3 sons: Evan, Ronald and Wilfrid. Evan became the secretary of the British Olympic Association.

He died at Lockerbie . He had 2 residences: one at Dixons in Lockerbie; the other at 7 York Place, Edinburgh. The value of his estate at death was recorded as £7827, 13 shillings and 7 pence. Hunter had 2 wills; one made in 1894 and another made in 1931 – the eik [ clarification needed ] was granted in 1934 to allow his sons to administer his estate. [ citation needed ] He is buried at the Dryfesdale Cemetery at Lockerbie.

Additionally, the home-keyboard model CT-6500 used 48 phase distortion presets. The CZ series was priced affordably while having professional features. In the same year Yamaha released their low-cost FM synthesizers, including the DX-21 and Yamaha DX100 which cost nearly twice as much.

Casio's phase distortion synthesis technique was championed by Casio engineer Mark Fukuda and evolved from the Cosmo Synth System that was developed in collaboration with  synthesist-composer Isao Tomita . Yukihiro Takahashi was also on board during development. To make the CZ synthesizers inexpensive, so they would be affordable to amateur musicians (a much larger market than the professional musician market), Casio used digital synthesis without a filter instead of traditional analog subtractive synthesis with a filter. Like many early digital synthesizers, its sound was regarded as "thinner" than the sound of an analog synthesizer. However, the CZ line used phase distortion to simulate an analog filter. It had in total eight different waveforms: as well as the standard sawtooth, square, and pulse waveforms, it had a special double sine waveform, a half-sine waveform, and three waveforms with simulated filter resonance: resonant sawtooth, triangle, and trapezoidal waveforms. The simulated filter resonance was not considered to sound much like real filter resonance, being a simple waveform at the filter cutoff value instead of a real filter resonating.

Each digital oscillator could have one or two waveforms. Unlike other synthesizers, where having multiple waveforms caused those multiple waveforms to be mixed together (parallel), the CZ synthesizers would play one waveform and then play the other, and so on in alternation (series). This could cause the appearance of a sub-harmonic one octave below the nominal pitch of the sound, due to the period of the combined waveform taking twice as long as a single waveform would. It was possible to combine two non-resonant waveforms together, and to combine a resonant waveform with a non-resonant waveform, but it was not possible to combine two resonant waveforms.

Digital Controlled Oscillator (DCO)

The CZ-101 and CZ-1000 have eight digital oscillators, each with a dedicated 8-stage pitch envelope. For patches using one oscillator per voice, this allows 8-note polyphony, If two oscillators per voice are used, the polyphony is limited to four voices. The CZ-3000, CZ-5000, and CZ-1 had sixteen digital oscillators, making them sixteen- or eight-voice synthesizers. Each of the oscillators in a two-oscillator patch could be independently programmed.

Digital Controlled Wave (DCW)

The DCW adjusts the magnitude of phase distortion that is applied to the oscillator. For non-resonant wave shapes, the DCW value adjusts the oscillator's harmonic content such that minimum setting produces a sine wave, while maximum setting produces the selected wave shape. For resonant-type wave shapes, the DCW value instead controls the perceived resonant frequency. The DCW can be modified using an 8-stage envelope, thus changing the timbre of the sound over time. In this capacity, it was described by Casio in the CZ-1's manual as being phase distortion synthesis's equivalent of the VCF (voltage-controlled filter) in analogue synthesisers.

Digital Controlled Amplifier (DCA)

The DCA (which determined how loud a given oscillator was at a given moment) was also modulated by another dedicated 8-stage envelope generator. The DCW and DCA also had a "key follow" feature; which determined how much higher notes affected a sound, making the DCW have a more dull sound with less harmonics with higher notes, and making the DCA envelope faster for higher notes.

Modulations

8-step Envelope Generators (EG)

The envelope generators in the CZ synthesizers were far more flexible than a traditional four-stage ADSR envelope ; they were eight stage envelope generators where each stage had a rate and level value. The rate value determined how fast the envelope would move; the level value would determine what pitch/filter cutoff/volume the envelope would have. Sustain and End point could be assigned to any stage of the envelope.

LFO

The synthesizers have a single configurable LFO for inducing vibrato, whose settings apply to all notes played in a given patch, although each note has its own independently triggered/cycling LFO (polyphonic LFOs). The LFO can use triangle, square, upwards (ramp) sawtooth, or downwards sawtooth waveforms. The modulatory effects of the LFO are controlled by three settings: speed, depth, and delay.

The pitch of a voice can also be modulated by a dedicated eight-stage envelope, although this can only increase the pitch of a sound, rather than being bidirectional.

Ring and Noise modulators

It was possible to modulate the two voices in a two-voice patch in two different ways. Ring modulation had the output of one of the oscillators affect the volume of the other oscillator, resulting in a controlled distortion. Noise modulation caused the second voice in a two-voice patch to sound like digital noise, roughly simulating the effect of an analog synthesizer's noise source.

Tone mix mode

The CZ synthesizers also had the ability to stack up two different sounds via the "tone mix" feature resulting in a functionally monophonic synthesizer; this was Casio's version of the "unison" feature other polyphonic synthesizers had. Each part in a two-patch stack could be a different patch, allowing great flexibility in stacked sounds. It was not possible to detune the two patches in a tone mix stack; this could be somewhat worked around, however, by giving each of the two patches a different vibrato rate.

Comparison to analogue subtractive synthesizers

The CZ synthesizers were missing some features common to analog synthesizers: LFO can't modulate DCW, which prevents pulse width modulation; the simulated resonance was an either-or proposition; with the exception of a resonant form, it did not have a triangle wave.

Individual models

CZ-101

The CZ-101 was the first and best-selling synthesizer in this line. Approximately 68,500 were manufactured. Released in November 1984, it was one of the first (if not the first)  fully programmable polyphonic synthesizers that was available for under $500. In order to keep the price low, several compromises were made. The CZ-101 only had 49 keys (4 octaves from C to C) instead of the 61 keys most synthesizers had. Instead of full sized keys, the CZ-101 used miniature keys. It had pegs for a guitar strap so it could be worn, a compartment for 6 D-size batteries, and a headphone output but no internal speaker.

CZ-230S

The CZ-230S was released in 1986. Despite the CZ-230S's model numbering, it was not really a programmable synthesizer; the specifications of this model more closely resembled that of one of Casio's home keyboard models. It used the synthesizer technology of the CZ-101 in a 100 tone preset sound bank, had a mini keyboard of 49 keys, incorporated the RZ1 drum computer technology and had a built-in speaker. Only four of the sounds in the sound bank could be programmed by linking the synthesizer to a computer via its MIDI port.

CZ-1000

The CZ-1000 was the second fully programmable phase distortion synthesizer that Casio introduced. This synthesizer, introduced in 1984, was identical to the CZ-101 in function, but used full size keys and more attractive membrane buttons. It was also somewhat larger than the CZ-101. Like the CZ-101, this synthesizer had 49 keys.

CZ-2000S

The CZ-2000S synthesizer was a model that was not sold in North America. It was identical to the CZ-3000 except that it also had built-in speakers.

CZ-2600S

The CZ-2600S synthesizer was a model that was not sold in North America. It was identical to the CZ-2000S except that it was a stereo model.

CZ-3000

The CZ-3000 synthesizer used the same phase distortion engine as the CZ-101 and the CZ-1000, but added the following features:

The synthesizer had eight voices instead of four voices (16 oscillators instead of eight)

It was possible to split the keyboard (in other words, have some keys play one sound while other keys played another sound).

The synthesizer had 61 keys, not 49 keys

There was a built-in stereo chorus effect

Instead of having just a pitch bend wheel, the CZ-3000 had both a pitch bend wheel and a modulation wheel.

CZ-5000

The CZ-5000 synthesizer was almost identical to the CZ-3000, but had a built in 8 track sequencer. In most other regards, it was virtually identical to the other CZ series synthesizers.

CZ-1

The CZ-1 synthesizer is most advanced in the CZ series. It doubled the memory, was multitimbral, also stored splits and layers as "Operation Memories", and added velocity and aftertouch sensitivity to the keyboard, along with programming parameters to control how velocity and aftertouch pressure would affect the sound. It features three modes 'normal' (1 tone 16 voice), 'tone mix' and 'key split' (2 tones with 8 voices each). In the 2 tone modes the chorus setting controls which tone goes to which of the left and right output channels. With external effects the lack of negative velocity volume control can be circumvented and velocity crossfades between tones can be achieved using the separate output channels. Page 12 of the CZ-1 operation manual explains the tone output channel settings. The CZ-1 also featured a backlit display which is lacking on the rest of the series. The only features that the CZ-1 lacked in comparison to some other models was the basic sequencer or drum machine sometimes furnished.

Related models

VZ series synthesizers

Casio VZ series utilize Interactive Phase Distortion synthesis (iPD synthesis). Although named similarly, this is much more similar to Yamaha-style phase modulation synthesis than to Casio-style PD: the modulators in iPD are oscillating waveforms, rather than the angular functions of the original PD. Thus the CZ and VZ engines are quite different and not directly compatible, filling different sonic and architectural niches.

Models:

VZ-1 (keyboard with 16 voices) a.k.a. Hohner HS-2 (rebadged for the European market)

VZ-10M (2U rack module; functionally identical to the VZ-1) a.k.a. Hohner HS-2/E

VZ-8M (1U rack module expander with 8 voices but a few new features)

Albright and Wilson was founded in 1856 as a United Kingdom manufacturer of potassium chlorate and white phosphorus for the match industry. For much of its first 100 years of existence, phosphorus-derived chemicals formed the majority of its products.

It was set up as a partnership between two Quakers , Arthur Albright, and John Edward Wilson. It became a private limited company , Albright & Wilson Ltd , in 1892; and it remained a double family-owned firm, for nearly 100 years, until 5 March 1948, when it became a public company .

Albright and Wilson expanded considerably into silicones , detergents , food additives, metal finishing chemicals, strontium based chemicals and chromium based chemicals. It was the second largest chemical manufacturer in the United Kingdom; although it was always very much smaller than ICI .

In 1971 Tenneco bought a part of Albright and Wilson's share holdings; and in 1978 obtained full ownership. In the short term, the company retained its own identity; however many of its subsidiaries were sold off. In 1995, Tenneco divested many of its assets; and parts of the original core of Albright and Wilson were transferred into a new public company, Albright and Wilson Plc which was floated on the stock market, in February of that year. However, just four years later, following disappointing results, the French chemical company Rhodia acquired Albright and Wilson in March 2000 and the century-and-a-half old name finally disappeared except in India, Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines.

Parts of the original Albright and Wilson company are now owned by the Huntsman Corporation after their sale in 2000.

After a large fire at its Avonmouth plant in 1996, which caused the temporary closure of local motorways and rail services, Albright and Wilson were fined £60,000.

The move to Oldbury

In 1842 Arthur Albright, a trained chemist , became a Partner in the Birmingham chemical firm of John and Edmund Sturge ; his sister had married Edmund Sturge who was also a Quaker. The Sturges were already manufacturing potassium chlorate for the match industry, at their chemical works at Selly Oak , adjacent to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal . Albright therefore added the production of white phosphorus in 1844.

In 1850 the production of potassium chlorate and white phosphorus was moved to Langley Green, Oldbury, West Midlands ; and production of white phosphorus restarted in 1851.

The new site was located next door to the firm of Chance and Hunt in order to obtain access to a supply of sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid ; and of coal from the Black Country coal fields. It was also adjacent to two different arms of the Birmingham Canal Navigations , (the BCN), one leading off the Titford Canal , so it had good transport links.

Production of the red form of phosphorus , "amorphous phosphorus" was commenced by Arthur Albright in 1851, by heating white phosphorus in a sealed crucible under a vacuum. It had been discovered by Professor Schrötter , in Vienna and patented by him. However, it was explosive to make and Albright discovered a safe means of production.

On 31 December 1854 Albright terminated his partnership with the Sturges. He formed Albright and Wilson with John Edward Wilson, a merchant , the following year. In 1856 John Edward Wilson became a partner, and the new partnership was known as Albright and Wilson. In 1857 John Wilson married the sister of Rachel Albright (Albright's wife).

The Sturge Brothers continued as manufacturing chemists at Birmingham, but moved their works to Stirchley ; and no longer had any involvement with phosphorus.

Oldbury remained the Headquarters of Albright and Wilson for most of the company's existence, eventually becoming known as the Oldbury Division. The Oldbury site was also the location of its central Research Laboratories.

The business was so highly regarded in Oldbury that a new secondary school opened in the town in the 1930s was named Albright Secondary Modern School . [1]

The firm also maintained a leased London office, at Knightsbridge Green . In October 1974 it moved its Industrial Chemicals Divisional Offices, from Oldbury, to Warley . The six-storey office block, A&W House, at 210–222 Hagley Road , was originally rented for 25 years. Fifteen years later, parts of the Head Office were moved from Knightsbridge Green to A&W House. In October 1991 the Head Office moved to A&W House; and in 1997 the freehold of the building was purchased. A&W House was sold in 2001; and is now known as Quadrant West.

Phosphorus and match phosphates

In the early days, white phosphorus was obtained from bone ash by treating them with hydrochloric acid to produce precipitated phosphates. Then heating the meta phosphate for several days in a sealed crucible , in a retort , and distilling off phosphorus vapour, under water. Huge quantities of coal were needed for heating these retorts.

The production of white phosphorus was improved by using phosphate rock and sulfuric acid instead of bone ash and hydrochloric acid; and by the use of reverberatory furnaces instead of the direct-heated furnaces.

White and amorphous phosphorus remained the main product of Albright and Wilson until World War I .

White phosphorus was poisonous to match makers, causing Phossy jaw . Albright and Wilson exhibited amorphous phosphorus at the Great Exhibition of 1851, at The Crystal Palace . A sample was taken away for testing by the two Swedish brothers Lundström , to make an experimental match composition. In 1855, just before the Paris Exhibition , John Edvard Lundstrom found that the matches were still usable. He placed a large order for amorphous phosphorus with Albright and Wilson and this led to the foundation of the Swedish Safety Match Industry.

In 1899 Albright and Wilson added phosphorus sesquisulfide production. They were the first company to produce phosphorus sesquisulfide commercially: it was fiery and dangerous to make. Two French chemists, Savene and Cahen, proved that year that it was non-poisonous and could be used to make safety matches. Savene and Cahen Patented the match formula.

In 1929 the British Match Corporation, formerly known as Bryant and May , set up a jointly-owned company with Albright and Wilson: The A & W Match Phosphorus Company. It took over ownership of a small part of the Oldbury site concerned with producing amorphous phosphorus and phosphorus sesquisulfide.

Expansion

Albright and Wilson expanded both by opening new sites and by buying up its rivals. The original phosphorus-based part of the company became known as the Oldbury Division. As they moved into new areas, they set up new Divisions.

Just after the end of World War I , Albright and Wilson took over the Holmes' Marine Life Protection Association . It remained within Oldbury Division.

Ann Street, Widnes

The works in Widnes , Cheshire, were used for Phosphorus production from 1933. The works started with 2 furnaces and gradually extended to 5. The manufacture of Phosphates continued as well as the production of Calgon (water softener). All the products produced here were based on Phosphoric Acid. In 1983, Albright and Wilson celebrated 50 Years at Ann Street.

Albright and Wilson was taken over by Rhodia and subsequently by Thermphos and operated until it closed in 2013, with the loss of 25 jobs. In 2010, 69 jobs were axed when production of food phosphates was transferred to Germany and the Netherlands, as a result of lower production costs abroad. As of 2015 [update] , the premises are being demolished, after Thermphos went into administration in September 2012 and following the full closure of the plant in 2013.

Oldbury Division

In 1888 a patent was granted to four people from Wolverhampton covering the use of an electric furnace to produce white phosphorus from phosphate rock; and in 1890 they set up a works at Wednesfield to produce phosphorus. Albright and Wilson bought the patent and the works; and ran it for two years whilst they built their own furnace at Oldbury. The Wednesfield works was then closed down.

White phosphorus continued in production at Oldbury until 1972 when production was moved to Newfoundland . Bulk liquid white phosphorus was then transferred by special bulk tanker ship back to Portishead , Somerset . Unfortunately the move to Newfoundland had been inadequately planned and the Company encountered serious production problems with its new giant electric furnaces – several times larger than the Oldbury machines – and with the availability of skilled local labour. These problems contributed to the company's poor financial performance and precipitated the take-over by Tenneco .

Marchon Division

In 1955 Albright and Wilson purchased Marchon Products Ltd based in Whitehaven , which produced phosphorus-based detergents by the "wet" process. The A&W Group now controlled production of phosphorus compounds by both important manufacturing routes. However, the phosphate detergent business, which was the bread-and-butter market for Marchon, ran into terminal decline in the late 1970s as the eutrophication of inland waterways by pollution from detergent phosphate residues pressed the detergent formulators to move away from phosphates, thus removing Marchon's prime product application area.

The name "Marchon" ended when the French company, Rhodia, took over Albright and Wilson in 1999.

The site closed down in 2005 and was demolished between 2007 and 2012.

Chakrabongse Bhuvanath ( Thai : จักรพงษ์ภูวนาถ ; RTGS : Chakkraphong Phuwanat ; 3 March 1883 – 13 June 1920), was the 40th child of King Chulalongkorn and the fourth child of Queen Sri Bajarindra .

Early life and education

The prince was sent to the Russian Empire in his teens, where he studied at the Page Corps and became an officer of His Majesty's Hussar Life Guards Regiment .

Family

He returned to Siam with a wife, Catherine Desnitski from Lutsk (at that time part of the Russian Empire , nowadays part of Ukraine), whom he had married in 1906. The Prince and his wife lived with their son, Prince Chula Chakrabongse , in Paruskavan Palace in Bangkok. They later divorced and he remarried the year before his death.

Royal careers

The prince was a favourite son of both the King and Queen. He travelled extensively, visiting among other countries the US and United Kingdom in 1902. He also represented his father on foreign visits, such as for the funeral of King Umberto I of Italy in 1900, the wedding of Crown Prince Wilhelm and Crown Princess Cecilie of Prussia in 1905, and the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary of the United Kingdom in 1911.

He and his brother Prince Purachatra , Commander of the Army Engineers, were instrumental in the development of aviation in the Kingdom. Prince Chakrabongse is best remembered today as the father of the army's Royal Aeronautical Service, a forerunner to the Royal Thai Air Force .

Prince Chakrabongse also served as Chief of Staff of the Royal Siamese Army until his death.

Death

He died from pneumonia in 1920 at the age of 37.

William Richard Bird (May 11, 1891 – 1984) was a Canadian writer. He authored fifteen novels, two memoirs, six history books and three travel books.

Early and personal life

He was born on May 11, 1891, in East Mapleton , to Augusta Bird, an educator, and Stephen Bird. A few years later his mother was left a widow with two stepsons and three sons as his father died of pneumonia . As a teenager, the family moved to the nearby town of Amherst , where his mother began running a boarding house. The family at this time was in need of money, so Will and his brother were unable to complete school. By the time he was twenty-three he decided to go to Alberta and work on the harvest to earn money. This was the case for many men from the East who were recruited to harvest crops on the prairies (see Harvest excursion ). [ citation needed ]

Soon afterwards, war broke out in Europe and Will's youngest brother, Stephen, was enlisted, being killed in France a year afterward. Bird had volunteered for service overseas at the same time as his brother, but was rejected due to his poor teeth. Will Bird returned home to Nova Scotia, wanting to take up his brother's place in the military, and he enlisted immediately. By this point in the war, the Canadian Expeditionary Force 's standards for dental health had been lowered; although Bird was required to have some teeth removed in Britain before being sent to the front in France. He served in France and Belgium at the front for two years with the Canadian Expeditionary Force ( 42nd Battalion (Royal Highlanders of Canada), CEF ). His time in the war impacted his life as a writer as his war experiences were constantly a part of his stories. One of his finest works, And We Go On (1930) documents his time in France. Another book, Ghosts Have Warm Hands recounts his experiences during the war and his emotional connection to his brother, Stephen, who was killed in action before Bird was allowed to volunteer for service.

Once he was demobilized in 1919, he returned to the village of Southampton, Nova Scotia , where he married Ethel Sutton. Together they had two children, Stephen and Betty. Will had become a partner in a general store there, but the store failed in 1923 and the family moved back to Amherst. There he found employment in the post office. [ citation needed ]

Bird died on January 28, 1984, aged 92, in Sackville, New Brunswick .

Career

While living in Southampton, he wrote his first story and won a newspaper essay contest; this was the beginning to his career as an author and in 1928 he decided to support his family by writing. His stories were accepted across North America by such magazines as the Saturday Evening Post , Toronto Star Weekly , Family Herald , Maritime Advocate and Weekly Star . His first book, A Century at Chignecto , was published in 1928 and was followed by a steady succession of fiction and non-fiction titles over the next 40 years. [ citation needed ]

In 1931, he was sent back to the battlefields of France by Maclean's Magazine to write a series called "Thirteen Years After". The series became a lecture tour and a book, published by MacLean's in 1931 and over the following five years was given to Canadian Legion branches throughout the Maritimes .

In 1933, he began work at the Nova Scotia Tourist Bureau, moving to Halifax in 1938, and he worked as chairman of the Historic Sites and Monuments Advisory Council, remaining there until his retirement in 1966. [ citation needed ]

When Canada went to war again in 1939, Bird lost his only son, Captain Stephen Stanley Bird, of the North Nova Scotia Highlanders . This caused him to enter a long period of writing, creating many stories that showed his grief. [ citation needed ]

Bird won the Ryerson Fiction Award twice, in 1945 for Here Stays Good Yorkshire and in 1947 for Judgment Glen . [ citation needed ]

Bird was president of the Canadian Authors Association from 1949 to 1950, and was succeeded by W. G. Hardy .

It was released in May 1988 as the lead single from Restless Heart's album Big Dreams in a Small Town .

Background

In the United States, the single reached the top position in the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in 1988. In Canada, the single peaked at the number-two position on the RPM Country Tracks chart.

Bill Balsley directed the song's music video , which premiered in early 1988.

Song co-writers Robbins and Stephenson later joined with Henry Paul to form the country group BlackHawk in 1992.

Content

In the song, the narrator sings that he has just left his girlfriend.  He questions the reason for their break-up, but says that he is trying to move on.  He bemoans that can't forget her blue eyes, and that they haunt him.

Inspiration

In an interview with The Boot , Robbins said that Van Stephenson provided the idea of the song when he started telling them about an old girlfriend from high school who he bumped into recently. He dated her until her family moved to Texas . When they reunited, all he could think about was how blue her eyes were.

Hackney London Borough Council , also known as Hackney Council , is the local authority for the London Borough of Hackney , in Greater London , England. It is a London borough council, one of 32 in London . The council has been under Labour majority control since 2002. Since 2002 the council has been led by a directly elected mayor . The council meets at Hackney Town Hall and has its main offices in the adjoining Hackney Service Centre.

History

There has been a Hackney local authority since 1856 when the Hackney District was created covering the two ancient parishes of Hackney and Stoke Newington , governed by an elected board. It was one of the lower tier authorities within the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works , which was established to provide services across the metropolis of London. In 1889 the Metropolitan Board of Works' area was made the County of London . The Hackney District was dissolved in 1894 and the vestries of each parish took on the functions previously exercised by the district board. In 1900 the lower tier of local government across London was reorganised into metropolitan boroughs , each with a borough council, including Hackney , Shoreditch and Stoke Newington .

The London Borough of Hackney and its council were created under the London Government Act 1963 , with the first election held in 1964 . For its first year the council acted as a shadow authority alongside the area's outgoing authorities, being the councils of the three metropolitan boroughs of Hackney, Shoreditch and Stoke Newington. The new council formally came into its powers on 1 April 1965, at which point the old boroughs and their councils were abolished. The council's full legal name is "The Mayor and Burgesses of the London Borough of Hackney".

From 1965 until 1986 the council was a lower-tier authority, with upper-tier functions provided by the Greater London Council . The split of powers and functions meant that the Greater London Council was responsible for "wide area" services such as fire, ambulance, flood prevention , and refuse disposal ; with the boroughs (including Hackney) responsible for "personal" services such as social care, libraries, cemeteries and refuse collection . The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986 and its functions passed to the London Boroughs, with some services provided through joint committees. Hackney became a local education authority in 1990 when the Inner London Education Authority was dissolved.

In the 1980s and early 1990s the left-wing Labour council clashed with the Conservative government on numerous occasions, notably during the rate-capping rebellion in 1985 and over the poll tax in 1990, with Hackney being one of the centres of the poll tax riots .

An independent inquiry in 1998 was highly critical of the council's handling of its investigations into one of its social workers, employed between 1981 and 1993, against whom a number of complaints of child sexual abuse had been made but he had been allowed to continue working. His position as a Labour activist and trade union official was said to have hindered proper investigations. The social worker himself was never convicted, having died of an AIDS -related illness in 1995, but the police subsequently reported that they had been about to arrest him at the time of his death. The local Labour party split when the allegations were made public, which was a contributory factor to the council going under no overall control for a number of years in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Since 2000 the Greater London Authority has taken some responsibility for highways and planning control from the council, but within the English local government system the council remains a "most purpose" authority in terms of the available range of powers and functions.

Powers and functions

The local authority derives its powers and functions from the London Government Act 1963 and subsequent legislation, and has the powers and functions of a London borough council. It sets council tax and as a billing authority also collects precepts for Greater London Authority functions and business rates. It sets planning policies which complement Greater London Authority and national policies, and decides on almost all planning applications accordingly.  It is a local education authority and is also responsible for council housing , social services, libraries, waste collection and disposal, traffic, and most roads and environmental health.

Political control

The council has been under Labour majority control since 2002.

The first election was held in 1964, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 1 April 1965. Political control of the council since 1965 has been as follows:

Leadership

Prior to 2002, political leadership was provided by the leader of the council and the mayor was a ceremonial role. The leaders from 1965 to 2002 were:

In 2002 the council changed to having a directly elected Mayor of Hackney with executive powers. The ceremonial functions previously exercised by the mayor are now undertaken by a speaker instead. The mayors since 2002 have been:

Elections

Since the last boundary changes in 2014 the council has comprised the elected mayor plus 57 councillors representing 21 wards , with each ward electing two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

Following the 2022 election and subsequent by-elections and changes of allegiance up to May 2024, the composition of the council (excluding the elected mayor's seat) was as follows:

The three independent councillors sit together as the "Hackney Independent Socialist Group". The next full council election is due in May 2026.

Premises

The council meets at Hackney Town Hall on Mare Street , which was completed in 1937 for the old Hackney Borough Council.

The River Vale Skeeters were an American professional ice hockey team based in River Vale, New Jersey .

History

River Vale was founded in 1939, after John Handwerg built an arena in northeast Bergen County adjacent to his golf course. The Skeeters regularly saw capacity crowds at the 4,000-seat arena, despite posting losing records in each of their first three seasons. The team was forced to suspend operations in 1942 after the United States entered World War II and the war office converted the rink for defensive purposes. After the war, the building was not converted back into a rink and the Skeeters were left for dead.

The Central Corridor is a rail line operated by the Union Pacific Railroad from near Winnemucca, Nevada to Denver, Colorado in the western United States . The line was created after the merger with the Southern Pacific Transportation Company by combining portions of lines built by former competitors. No portion of the line was originally built by the Union Pacific; in fact, some portions were built specifically to compete with the Union Pacific's Overland Route . The line is known for significant feats of engineering while crossing the Wasatch Mountains of Utah and the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. The line features numerous tunnels; the longest and highest of these is the Moffat Tunnel .

Usage

The line is primarily used for freight by the Union Pacific.  The BNSF Railway has trackage rights on the entire line; the Utah Railway has trackage rights from Salt Lake City to Grand Junction, Colorado . However, parts of the line host significant passenger rail traffic. Amtrak 's California Zephyr uses the entire length of the Central Corridor, as part of its San Francisco to Chicago route. In addition, the portion from Salt Lake City to Provo, Utah hosts a separate, dedicated track built by the Utah Transit Authority for the southern half of the FrontRunner commuter rail service. A portion of the route immediately northwest of Denver also has dedicated electrified tracks for use by RTD commuter rail .

Route description

Nevada

Proceeding east out of Winnemucca , the route follows the Humboldt River , in a directional running setup with the Overland Route until Wells, Nevada . From Wells to Salt Lake, the route, known as the Shafter Subdivision , loosely follows the historical route of the Hastings Cutoff , tunneling underneath the Pequop Mountains and crossing the Toano Range via Silver Zone Pass. The eastern approach to Silver Zone Pass features a near 360 degree horseshoe curve known as the Arnold loop. After crossing these mountain ranges the route proceeds southwest towards the Great Salt Lake Desert . In Nevada, Interstate 80 follows the Central Corridor, though the two routes are several miles apart in places.

Utah

The route enters Utah at Wendover and crosses the Great Salt Lake Desert and the Bonneville Salt Flats , parallel to Interstate 80 and the Wendover Cut-off , en route to the southern shore of the Great Salt Lake and Salt Lake City . Upon reaching Salt Lake City, the line turns south and follows the Jordan River through Point of the Mountain towards Spanish Fork .

After Spanish Fork, the rail line joins the U.S. Route 6 corridor, and the two follow each other towards Denver. Both routes follow the Spanish Fork (river) up a grade in the Wasatch Plateau , cresting at Soldier Summit . The western approach to Soldier Summit is known for the Gilluly loops, a series of horseshoe curves that allow the railroad to crest the mountains while maintaining grade that never exceeds 2.4%, unlike the highway, which was built using an older railroad grade, that features grades in excess of 5%. The railroad descends from Soldier Summit following the Price River until reaching the town of Helper , so named because in the era of steam locomotives , the railroad added or removed helper engines here for trains crossing Soldier Summit. Upon exiting the Wasatch Mountains , the train follows the southern rim of the Book Cliffs , in route serving the towns of Woodside , Green River (where the rail line crosses the Green River ), Thompson Springs and Cisco . Near Cisco is where the rail line for the first time meets the Colorado River , which provides the path up the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. The rail line follows and crosses the river numerous times in Colorado while ascending the Rockies. Ruby Canyon is where the rail line reaches the state line.

Colorado

The railroad enters Colorado along the north bank of the Colorado River, following the river to the Grand Valley , passing through the heart of Grand Junction and surrounding cities along the way. The tracks continue to follow the river out of the valley, routed along Debeque Canyon , Glenwood Canyon and Gore Canyon of the Colorado River towards Granby, Colorado near the headwaters of the river. The railroad departs the main stem of the Colorado river to follow the Fraser River , one of its tributaries until reaching the crest of the Rocky Mountains which is surmounted via the Moffat Tunnel . With the decommissioning of the route over Tennessee Pass , the Moffat Tunnel is the highest point on the Union Pacific system.

The eastern descent from the Moffat Tunnel towards the Front Range , where Denver resides, features 33 tunnels, leading to this portion commonly called the Tunnel District. This portion of the tracks loosely follows Colorado State Highway 72 , though at points the two corridors are in different canyons and several miles apart. Even past where the tracks exit the Rocky Mountains, the grade features horseshoe curves in the final descent. The tracks approach the Denver metropolitan area from the northwest, before merging with other rail lines just north of downtown Denver.

The Union Pacific has divided the Central Corridor into these subdivisions for operational purposes:

Elko Subdivision from Winnemucca to Elko, Nevada

Shafter Subdivision from Elko to the Smelter ( Kennecott Smokestack ) in Utah

Lynndyl Subdivision from Smelter to Salt Lake City, Utah

Provo Subdivision from Salt Lake City to Helper, Utah

Green River Subdivision from Helper, Utah to Grand Junction, Colorado

Glenwood Springs Subdivision from Grand Junction to Bond, Colorado

Moffat Tunnel Subdivision from Bond to Denver

History

All of the Central Corridor was built by former competitors to the Union Pacific. The portion from Winnemucca to Salt Lake City, Utah was originally part of the Feather River Route , built by the Western Pacific Railroad , acquired by the Union Pacific in 1983. The portion from Salt Lake City to Grand Junction, Colorado is the former Utah Division of the Denver and Rio Grande Western (D&RGW). From Grand Junction to Dotsero, Colorado was part of the Tennessee Pass Line, also built by the D&RGW. From Dotsero to Bond, Colorado is the former Dotsero Cutoff , built by the D&RGW as a connection between their main line with the main of the unfinished Denver and Salt Lake Railroad , which provided the connection from Bond to Denver, Colorado . The portion east of Salt Lake City came under the Union Pacific's control from the 1996 acquisition of the Southern Pacific Transportation Company . The Western Pacific and D&RGW portions of the line were part of the Gould transcontinental system .

During 2022 and 2023 the Central Corridor was at the center of controversy, due to the fact that with the Uinta Basin Railroad construction project in Utah , an increase in the number of trains loaded with waxy-crude Oil that would run daily through the Corridor was projected. The project also included an eventual reactivation of the line from Dotsero to Pueblo through the Tennessee Pass (out of service since 1997) to decompress the Central Corridor should it operate at the limit of its maximum daily train capacity.

Both Eagle County and environmental groups lobbied hard to put the project on hold for the time being, citing the potential risks of increased oil train daily traffic both in the Central Corridor and eventually through Tennessee Pass. One of the major concerns that both Eagle County and environmental groups indicated is that if a major derailment were to occur on the Central Corridor or Tennessee Pass route with the resulting Oil spill, the environmental consequences to the Colorado River (which runs adjacent to the Central Corridor rail tracks), or the Arkansas River , which runs adjacent to the Tennessee Pass tracks, would be catastrophic.

Francis Oliver "Frank" Haddock (November 14, 1892 – February 3, 1934) was an American police officer who, along with fellow patrolman Forbes McLeod (January 1, 1898 – February 2, 1934), were killed in the line of duty while responding to a bank robbery. They were the first two officers in Massachusetts state history to be murdered by an assailant using a sub-machine gun, and the crime attracted attention across the northeastern United States. Their sacrifices are commemorated by the city of Needham , Massachusetts through its Haddock-McLeod Plaza.

Life

Haddock was born in Newton , Massachusetts , the son of William Oliver Haddock (May 12, 1861 – February 7, 1903) and Elizabeth Helen McAdams (March, 1864 – April 22, 1901). His two oldest siblings died in infancy, and he and his older brother Joseph Ernest "Joe" Haddock (February 15, 1891 – January 17, 1954) and younger sister Mary Florence "Mae" Haddock (May 30, 1894 – April 16, 1965) were orphaned upon Ellen’s death in 1901. William had fled from Newton for unknown reasons to Chicago around 1899.

The children were sent to different homes; Mae to her first cousin (twice removed) on her mother’s side Francis Alonso McAdams and his wife Ellen (Slattery), Frank to the home of Mary J. (O’Brien) Kingsbury, and Joe to a local farmer. Apparently, conditions on the farm were harsh, for Frank used to visit Joe, find him hungry, and would sneak back at night with food for him. Kingsbury, the elderly widow of Amasa Kingsbury (whose family were prominent early residents and citizens of Needham) who resided on a farm on Greendale Avenue then on the outskirts of town, alerted authorities and Joe went to live with the McAdams’.

Haddock enlisted in the Army in June, 1917 and spent the remainder of World War I driving an ambulance at Camp Upton, NY, discharged sergeant first class. He had met and then married on Apr. 24, 1919, Helen Frances "Nell" Callanan (October 18, 1893 – October 27, 1979), in Newton. They settled in Needham, and in 1920 he became one of the first full-time officers hired by Needham. There, they raised four daughters, Mary Florence Haddock (March 21, 1920 – June 2, 1987), Helen Veronica Haddock (March 31, 1923 – March 17, 2009), Dorothy Frances Haddock (August 13, 1924 – June 12, 1993), and Phyllis Teresa Haddock (September 1, 1926 – March 9, 2007).

Haddock was a popular member of the force and especially concerned with children, even as he was stern with juvenile delinquents, and family, given the background of own formative years. He would invite them to dine with the family during the Depression years, and until his death coordinated the junior crossing guard program for schools. He enjoyed the close family relations on his wife’s side and especially holidays; at Christmas, he would decorate lavishly the house and yard at 4 River Park Drive (that site now part of an interchange on Massachusetts Route 128 , with the house having been moved nearby and still owned by the family). He also liked gardening and typically had a thriving set of flower beds in addition to vegetables during the warmer months. He especially prized bulbs and plants brought back from flower shows across the country by one of Needham’s prominent knitwear manufacturers and philanthropists, William Carter.

Death

At 9:30 AM on Feb. 2, 1934, the Needham Trust Company was robbed by the trio of Murton Millen, Irving Millen, and Abraham Faber. Prior to their exiting the bank, McLeod was shot fatally three times, from a short distance, with Murton Millen the likely triggerman. The bandits took two hostages who they placed on the running board of their car facing the street and proceeded to drive away. Off duty police Sgt. Howard Mills saw them drive off, took down the description of the car and its direction of travel, and called police headquarters at 9:34.

This was in the direction of Needham Heights, which then (since demolished) had a fire station that was part of the beat of Haddock. He happened to be there commiserating with the on-duty firemen after his crossing guard duties when a call came from fire department headquarters about the robbery at 9:45. Informed, Haddock went to the front of the station, pistol drawn, only to hold fire as one hostage (the other having leapt to safety moments earlier) remained on the running board. Machine gun fire came from the car, striking Haddock three times with two mortal wounds. Helped onto a truck and driven to Glover Memorial Hospital, he died there early the next day.

Legacy

The town was shocked by the event. Its offices closed on Feb. 5 for the funeral of McLeod, and Feb. 6 for that of Haddock and hundreds turned out in bitterly cold weather with snow on the ground. Both days a parade of officers escorted the coffins through town in the funeral processions. At that time there was no formal pension plan for officers, but the Needham Citizens’ Committee granted a payment of $50 a month for Haddock’s family that would last for the remainder of his wife’s life; she never remarried. The incident also spurred the cash-strapped town government to buy more equipment for the department and to hire more officers.

In 2001, the town decided to rename the plaza in front of police headquarters after the two slain officers. A ceremony on May 15, attended by the two surviving daughters Helen Sadow and Phyllis Murphy and by other relatives, dedicated a plaque in their honor. For many years prior and continuing since, pencil drawings of the officers have hung in the station itself.

In 2009 on the 75th anniversary of the event, in conjunction with the Needham Historical Society, a memorial to the officers was placed at the site, the plaque having disappeared. Of Haddock’s children only Helen Sadow, who would live just six weeks more, remained alive but was too ill to travel, however his great grandson Brian Barnicle (daughter Mary's grandson) attended with his wife Crystale and two children Sahsha and James.

Within days of the crime, Faber was apprehended, followed by the Millens and Murton Millen’s wife Norma, who had waited in the getaway car. A trial quickly followed establishing their guilt of the murder of McLeod and on Jun. 7, 1935, the Millen brothers and Faber were executed. Norma Millen was convicted of being an accessory to the crimes and was sentenced to a year of imprisonment.

The robbery and aftermath was featured as "The Millen-Faber Case" in Issue #24 of True Crime Comics , published in November, 1942. A documentary about the crime, by Risner Productions, appeared on the local Needham public access channel with the initial public showing of the film having occurred Feb. 16, 2013, at the Needham Town Hall. In 2015, Nathan Gorenstein (related to the Millens) published the most exhaustive accounting to date of the crime, entitled Tommy Gun Winter .

Haddock has a memorial inscription (panel 62, W-10) as part of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC.

Haddock’s grandson Michael Murphy serves as a Police Sergeant in Addison, Texas . [ citation needed ] Haddock's granddaughter, Monica Pratt, is a magazine editor and writer in Redlands, California. [ citation needed ] Another grandson is political scientist and opinion columnist Jeffrey Sadow . [ citation needed ]

With Haddock’s death, this ended a streak of three generations of Haddocks with the first or middle name of "Oliver" who died prematurely; his father died of pneumonia, and his grandfather Oliver James Haddock (November 2, 1837 – July 2, 1871), discharged from the Army for wounds suffered during the Civil War, died of consumption.

Nada Klaić (21 July 1920 – 2 August 1988 ) was a Croatian historian . She was a 20th century Croatian medievalist . She, also, devoted a substantial part of the work to criticism of medieval sources.

Academic career

Nada Klaić was born in Zagreb , the granddaughter of the historian Vjekoslav Klaić and sister of landscape architect Smiljan Klaić . She was a university professor and a prominent Croatian medievalist, graduated at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Zagreb , the same faculty where she was involved in teaching for 45 years. She started her teaching and scientific career at the faculty's Department of History in 1943, to become a full professor of the Croatian medieval history in 1969. This position she held until her death in 1988.

From 1946, when she took her doctor's degree with the thesis Političko i društveno uređenje Slavonije za Arpadovića (Political and Social Organization of Slavonia under the Árpád dynasty ), she spent several decades engaged in researching Croatian medieval history. Nada Klaić gathered the results of her extensive analytical investigations, published first in journals and proceedings, and monographs and surveys of Croatian history. She died in her home city of Zagreb.

Historical studies

She researched the period from the arrival of the Slavs (see Migration Period ) until the 19th century. Under the early influence of M. Barada, Lj. Hauptmann, B. Grafenauer and J. Šidak, she contributed to the Croatian Medievalism by writing papers about social history. The book History of the Yugoslav Peoples II (1959) includes her comprehensive overview of the history of Croatia in the Early Modern Times , including elements of economic and social history.

She paid special attention to the history of cities, as shown by several studies and books: Zadar in the Middle Ages until 1409 (with Ivo Petricioli, 1976), Zagreb in the Middle Ages (1982), Notes on Vukovar in the Middle Ages (1983), Trogir in the Middle Ages: Public Life of the City and its Inhabitants (1985), Koprivnica in the Middle Ages (1987).

She authored numerous works regarding revolts and social conflicts, which she collected in the book Social Turmoil and Revolts in Croatia in the 16th and 17th Centuries (1976). She described the role of specific nobles in the books The Last Dukes of Celje in the Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen (1982) and Medvedgrad and its Masters (1987).

Much of her work is the analysis and publication of historical sources. Relying partly on the contributions of earlier historians, she analyzed the entire Croatian diplomatic material of the Early Middle Ages ( Diplomatic Analysis of the Documents from the Age of Croatian Rulers of Croat Descent , 1965, 1966–67), questioning its authenticity. Along with the anonymous Split chronicle called Historia Salonitana maior (1967), Klaić published several sources translated from Latin for the needs of students ( Sources for Croatian History before 1526 , 1972).

She provided a comprehensive and original concept of the early medieval development of the Croatian lands in the book History of the Croats in the Early Middle Ages (1971), while she collected her writings about numerous problems of the later period in the book History of the Croats in the High Middle Ages (1976). Her posthumously published books are Medieval Bosnia : Political Status of Bosnian Rulers before the Coronation of Tvrtko in 1377 (1989) and History of the Croats in the Middle Ages (1990).

Influence

Klaić was one of the most prominent Croatian and Yugoslavian medievalist in the 20th century. Some of her achievements are the innovative and modern approach to Croatian history (especially for the Middle Ages), which helped release it from the romantic nationalism of the 19th century, and the revaluation of older historical sources. However, a substantial portion of her views and conclusions are controversial and the work provoked strong reactions in historiography. For example, that the document Pacta conventa is a forgery probably made in the 14th century, her "lack of opinion" over the matter of 1102 in a 1959 article disputing Croatian writer Oleg Mandić's earlier work on the matter, and her view on the Croatian migration and old homeland in the 7th century, as well other topics of the early Croatian history.

Klaić was highly critical about the work by some scholars like Ferdo Šišić (which she dismissed as poorly analysed), or Lj. Hauptmann (regarding the thesis of Croats migration from White Croatia and the Iranian-Caucasian theory of the origin of early Croats). Her firm assumptions on the origin and early homeland of Croats based on Margetić's thesis whereby the Croats arrived to Dalmatia in the late 8th or early 9th century, although Margetić emphasized it was only an assumption, which he later reportedly rejected. The German and Austrian scholars H. Kunstmann, J. Herrmann, R. Werner and O. Kronsteiner loose considerations on Slavs were especially influential on her viewpoints.

Klaić posited that there was no Slavic migration from North to South, but rather from South to North, as the Slavs were indigenous to the Balkan, therefore was no migration of the so-called White Croats from the White Croatia in Carantania . She supported the thesis by H. Kunstmann that Slavs did not have their own tribal names, and their names should be traced to the Illyrian, Greek and Byzantine cultural milieu. She believed the Croats were Slavs in the Avar Khaganate ruled by the Avars, and as such firmly considered that Croatian state organization and titles župan and ban were of Avar origin. She thought the discovered graves which dated from before the 9th century belonged to the Avars, not Croats, and that the Avars lived in Dalmatia. Neven Budak shared this view, but he later abandoned it.

This and other views, such as the Gothic administrative origin of Liburnia and the existence of Avarian županijska Liburnia , banska Liburnia and županijska Istria , as well her constant consideration of incompetence of the archaeologists in the absence of proof for her theories, were criticized and dismissed by modern scholars like P. Štih as lacking bases in reliable evidence and sources. Miroslav Brandt claimed that Klaić, even though she was usually described as iconoclast, is a protégé of socialist Yugoslavia in her approach to Croatian historiography.

Górski was the author of several books and pamphlets on self-governance and cooperation . He was considered one of the most important figures in the contemporary Polish anarchist movement .

Personal life and activism

In 1988 to 1990, Górski was a member of Federation of Fighting Youth (Federacja Młodzieży Walczącej) and the Youth Organization of the Confederation of Independent Poland (Konfederacja Polski Niepodległej or KPN). In mid 1989, Górski became head of the youth organization of KPM, where he remained in the organization till 1991. At age 16, Górski participated in the fights of the 1989 Kraków May, where youth from ZOMO fought against the election campaign of Leszek Moczulski , who ran for a mandate from the list of the Confederation of Independent Poland in the contract elections. In 1989, Górski also took part in the protests in Warsaw against the election of Wojciech Jaruzelski as President of Poland and in Kraków in protests at the Soviet consulate . He later participated in ZSMP's and PZPR's occupation of the consulate in September 1989, and December 1989, respectively, and was involved in a series of street fights in Nowa Huta at the Lenin monument . In 1990, he supported the election campaigns of KPN members to the Kraków City Council, and participated in protests at the Soviet consulate against their aggression towards Lithuania in January 1991 . He also took part in the Trail of the First Cadre Company March from Kraków to Kielce .

In 1991, Górski joined Anarchist Federation (Kraków section), the Free Caucasus Committee and the Committee for the Assistance and Defense of Repressed Workers . Within these organizations, he helped co-organize a number of protests, including a blockade against the construction of Czorsztyn Dam ), which resulted in a number of arrests.

In 1995, Górski was arrested and jailed for his role in the occupation of the Delegation of the Ministry of Privatization building in Kraków and for previous charges of resisting police during the Dam Tamie in Czorsztyn , in July 1992. Anarchists and members of KPN rallied in his defence, including MP Leszek Moczulski , who issued a surety for Górski. Górski was sentenced to a fine and was released following three weeks of hunger strike while being held in custody.

On 8 February 2002, Górski was arrested on suspicion of attacking a police officer during an eviction blockade earlier in the year. Anarchist organizations criticized the arrest, claiming that his detention was an attempt by police to "silence the citizens". Górski had originally planned a demonstration for the following day. Once news of his arrest reached anarchist circles, anarchists across Poland carried out "Liberate Górski" campaigns, in an effort to draw attention to his "unfounded arrest". Górski was sentenced to eight months in prison, which was later commuted to two years of probation .

Górski later served as a domestic and international delegate to the anarcho-syndicalist trade union, Workers' Initiative . He was a founder of the Environmental Commission in Kraków, in 2008.

From 2000 to 2004, he co-edited the anarchist periodical A-tak. In his writings, Górski wrote predominately on the theory and practicality of Representative Democracies , the history of anarchism and syndicalism in Poland, and on the popularity of cooperatives. In 2007, he published Without the State. Democracy that participates in action, which was described by the publisher as "the answer to the crisis of liberal democracy". This book, divided into three parts, discusses the impacts of representative democracy on local governments, workplaces and the judiciary. In this book, Górski discusses the difference between the theory and practice of democracy, specifically stating in the preface "many myths that have arisen around participatory democracy: that it is a beautiful system, but impossible to implement" In 2008, he published Polish assassins and in 2009, he published the article What if the transport was free?
