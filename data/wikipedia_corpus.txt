The Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui (abbreviated SKH), also known as the Hong Kong Anglican Church (Episcopal), is the Anglican church in Hong Kong and Macao. It is the 38th Province of the Anglican Communion. It is also one of the major denominations in Hong Kong and the first in the Anglican Communion to ordain a female priest.
The Province of Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui is divided into three dioceses in Hong Kong and one missionary area in Macau. Each diocese is led by a bishop and the missionary area is directly led by the Archbishop.
The primate of Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui holds the title of Archbishop of Hong Kong, and is elected from the diocesan bishops of the province. Andrew Chan is the current Archbishop and Primate and Bishop of Western Kowloon. Timothy Kwok is Bishop of Eastern Kowloon and Matthias Der is Bishop of Hong Kong Island. Peter Douglas Koon is the provincial secretary general. The church has approximately 29,000 members.

Anglican Communion
The Anglican Communion is a global family and a fellowship of churches which trace their roots to the Church of England, with a province being a basic autonomous unit. There are presently 41 independent and self-governing provinces spanning over 160 countries. With well over 100 million members, the Anglican Communion is the third largest church in the world, after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches.
In the Anglican Communion, there is no central governing authority. Churches uphold and proclaim the Catholic and Apostolic faith. The front-line unit of Church is the "parish". Parishes of similar vicinity are then grouped together to form a "diocese". Dioceses sharing similar cultural and national background would unite and form a "province", participating in the Anglican Communion under the leadership and jurisdiction of an archbishop.
The Four Instruments of Unity for the Anglican Communion:

Anglican faith
The Anglican faith is based on the belief that the Bible, the Holy Scriptures of the Old and the New Testaments, "contain[s] all things necessary to salvation". Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui further maintains the ministry of the Church which it has received through the Episcopacy in the three orders of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons.

History and origin
Sheng Kung Hui was founded in British Hong Kong in 1843, following the Treaty of Nanking. The first colonial chaplain was Vincent John Stanton. The first Chinese church, St. Stephen's Church, was founded in 1865. From then onwards, in the course of development of the Anglican Church in Hong Kong and Macao, churches continued to grow and witnessed the establishment of the Diocese of Victoria (Chinese: 維多利亞教區) in 1849 under the See of Canterbury; the establishment of the Kong Yuet Diocese (Chinese: 港粵教區) under the Province of the Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui (Chinese: 中華聖公會) in 1913, which ran in parallel with the Diocese of Victoria, until it resolved in 1951; and the birth of the Diocese of Hong Kong and Macao (Chinese: 港澳教區) in 1951, which was subsequently completely separated from the national Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui.
In the 40th Synod of the Diocese held in December 1991, it was resolved that steps were to be taken to expand the Diocese into a province and eventually in 1998, the Province of Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui was established.

Structure
Dioceses and Missionary Area
Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui consists of three dioceses and one missionary area. There is a bishop in each diocese. The dioceses are:

The Diocese of Hong Kong Island (香港島教區)
The Diocese of Eastern Kowloon (東九龍教區)
The Diocese of Western Kowloon (西九龍教區)
(The Diocese of Eastern Kowloon and the Diocese of Western Kowloon are divided by the geographical constituencies of the Legislative Council in the New Territories, and along the Kowloon-Canton Railway in Kowloon and New Kowloon.)
The missionary area is:

The Missionary Area of Macao (澳門傳道地區)

Parishes and churches
General synod
The Provincial General Synod is composed of the House of Bishop, the House of Clegy and the House of Laity. Members come from the Diocese of Hong Kong Island, the Diocese of Eastern Kowloon, the Diocese of Western Kowloon and the Missionary Area of Macao. Under the General Synod, there are different Commissions responsible for different areas of ministry.

Mission and pastoral work
The Church is a community with no boundaries in age, social or ethnic status. Members include Chinese, other Asians and Westerners from all over the world. The worship in Churches features English, Filipino, Cantonese Chinese and Mandarin Chinese.

Pastoral Care
On the parish level, pastoral care is given through fellowships for children, youth, adults, women, elderly and other related groups to cater to the different needs of people of various age groups and background. Retreats, silent meditation, pilgrimage and tours to Israel are often arranged. Caring for the elderly, family counseling service, spiritual support in hospitals, pastoral care in correctional institutes, mission to Seafarers and religious service at the Airport are some of the Church's services.
Religious Education
Religious education of parishes are carried out by Sunday Schools, seminars, disciple training courses and catechism class, among others. The whole Church relies on the Religious Education and Resource Centre to co-ordinate religious education research, provision of religious education curriculum and promotion of religious education. Besides training ordinands, Ming Hua Theological College also provides multi-faceted theological, spiritual and biblical studies for laity.

Social service
Social service of the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui started in mid 18th Century. At present, many social service organizations and social service models in Hong Kong were those initiated and promoted by the Church. Services provided by the Church are multi-faceted, including services for family and child-care, children and youth, the elderly, rehabilitation service, community development service and other supportive services. There are more than 230 units providing social service run by Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui at present.
In January 2010, the Inland Revenue Department began to pursue the SKH for unpaid taxes in the amount of HK$180 million, relating to a parcel of land in Tai Po which originally housed an orphanage. In 1993, after the closure of the orphanage, the SKH let Cheung Kong Holdings develop luxury apartments on the site, and were estimated to have made profits of HK$450 million in cash, in addition to receiving 120 apartments for free.

Social issues
On women's ordination, the church was the first in the Anglican Communion to ordain women to the priesthood: Florence Li Tim-Oi in 1944 and another in 1971. Churches in Hong Kong and "Christian clerics are often divided on topics such as... gay rights". In 2007, the former primate, Archbishop Peter Kwong, stated that "Anglicanism is inclusive...so why shouldn't we find a common ground on homosexuality?". Beginning in 2013, some leaders in the Hong Kong Anglican Church endorsed social and civil rights legislation under the auspice of providing protection for LGBT citizens from employment and other varieties of discrimination. The Equal Opportunity Commission chair, York Chow Yat-ngok, who is Anglican, said that gay "people should not be discriminated against" regardless of religious views. Later, in 2015, Peter Douglas Koon, the Anglican province's secretary general, denounced conservative schools' policies against LGBT relationships as discrimination and reassured the public that Anglican educational institutions would welcome LGBT faculty and students.

SKH Ming Hua Theological College
Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui runs its own theological college: Ming Hua Theological College, named after Bishop Ronald Owen Hall.
Ming Hua College was established in 1947 by Bishop R.O. Hall in what was then the Church of England’s Diocese of Victoria. It was at first dedicated to the education of Chinese lay Christians, particularly from disadvantaged backgrounds.
In 1996, now part of the Diocese of Hong Kong and Macao, the College was renamed Sheng Kung Hui ("Holy Catholic Church") Ming Hua Theological College and given the responsibility of training priests for full-time ministry in the Church. This work continues today as part of the Anglican Province of Hong Kong and Macao, with Ming Hua being the Provincial training centre for clergy and laity.

Hrvatski nogometni klub Šibenik (English: Croatian Football Club Šibenik), better known as HNK Šibenik or simply Šibenik (pronounced [ʃîbeniːk]), is a Croatian professional football club based in Šibenik. It competes in the SuperSport HNL, the top flight of Croatian football and plays their home matches at the Stadion Šubićevac, which has a capacity of 3,970.

History
The club was formed in 1932 under the name Radničko sportsko društvo Šibenik (Workers' Sport Association Šibenik). The first president, Dr Martin Čičin-Šain, was only appointed to this role during the first board meeting, which was held in August 1933. They played in a stadium in the town area of Crnica, next to the La Dalmatienne factory. The playing field was officially opened on 31 May 1936. The first matches played were part of a 1936 tournament between Šibenik, Osvit, Split and AŠK. Around the same time the first registered football club in Šibenik was also formed. This club was called Osvit and it was responsible for the construction of Šubićevac Stadium.
The club played its first official league match in 1946 under the name FD Šibenik and the very next year it was crowned the champion of the Dalmatia region. The club's new home ground was opened on 1 May 1948 and bore the name of "the people's hero", Rade Končar. In the 1950–51 season, Šibenik finished top of the Croatian Republic League and gained promotion to the Yugoslav Second League for the first time in its history. However, they were relegated immediately and it was not until 1954–55 that they returned to the second division. In 1957 the club made it to the semi-final of the Yugoslav Cup.
In 1983 Šibenik made it back to the Yugoslav Second League, where they played in the West Division, composed from 18 clubs from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and SAP Vojvodina. In their first season (1983–84) they finished fourth, while in the 1984–85 season they came close second, only three points behind the champion Čelik Zenica, thus falling short of winning promotion to the Yugoslav First League. This was their best result in the Yugoslav Second League ever. After holding the middle position of the table for the next couple of seasons, Šibenik finished fifth in the 1987–88 season. They defended their fifth place in the 1988–89 season, the first Yugoslav Second League season which featured a unified format instead of two divisions (West and East), as well as in the 1989–90 season.
Šibenik played in the Croatian First League for twelve consecutive seasons, from 1992 until 2003. In 2006 the club finished first in the Croatian Second League's southern division and returned to the first league. In the 2009–10 season, Šibenik finished fourth in domestic league, which was their best result ever, and thus qualified for the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League first qualifying round for the first time in its history. They were eliminated in the second qualifying round by Anorthosis Famagusta 2–3 on aggregate.
In the 2011–12 season, the club finished fourteenth and were relegated to the second league. In the following season, Šibenik finished fourth but due to financial difficulties, they were once again relegated to the third league. In the 2013–14 season, Šibenik finished in second place with their marksman Miro Slavica scoring 30 goals to take out the league's top goalscorer award, but failed to lead his side to promotion.
At the end of the 2014–15 season, Šibenik gained promotion to the second league, topping the third league – south. Mirko Labrović took over as manager in 2015. They finished close second to Cibalia in the 2015–16 season, failing to beat them in the last match of the season and thus failing to win direct promotion to the first tier by only one point. Šibenik played against Istra 1961 in the relegation play-offs on 29 May and 1 June 2016. Both matches ended 1–1 and Šibenik lost the play-off after penalty shootout.
In the 2018–19 season, Šibenik finished a close second to Varaždin, and again played relegation play-offs over Istra 1961. The first match played in Šibenik ended 1–1 but in the second match played on Stadion Aldo Drosina, Istra beat them by a scoreline of 0–2. On 6 May 2020, by a decision of the Croatian Football Federation to suspend the 2019–20 Croatian Second League season, Šibenik was promoted to the first tier after eight seasons.

The Ely LDS Stake Tabernacle was built by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1927-1928 as a church and community center in Ely, Nevada. The two-story Colonial Revival building is now owned by White Pine County and is used as a community meeting hall. The contractor for the project was Joseph Don Carlos Young, grandson of Brigham Young.
The stake tabernacle is an unusual example of Colonial Revival design in Nevada, where the style was never widely used. It is also notable as an early example of the expansion of the LDS Church into neighboring states. The LDS church first was established in Ely in 1915. In 1926 the Ely Ward was established. The tabernacle was completed in 1928, containing a 600-seat auditorium, meeting space and classrooms. The facility was replaced by a new meetinghouse in 1957.

Joel Keller of Decider wrote, "Despite the series' scattershot focus, America The Beautiful has more than enough spectacular footage to satisfy fans of nature docuseries." John Anderson of The Wall Street Journal said, "It's a feel-good physical exam of the third largest and "most diverse" continent, environmentally speaking, and while there's no voice saying, "I'm North America and I approve this message," if a place could run for president, this show could be the campaign ad."
Stephanie Morgan of Common Sense Media gave America the Beautiful a grade of 4 out of 5 stars, praised the presence of educational value, and complimented the positive messages and role models, writing, "Nature footage and storytelling like nothing seen before." Aimee Mills of Collider included America the Beautiful in their "10 Best Wildlife Documentaries On Disney+ Right Now" list, saying, "With stunning shots of nature at its finest, it's a great new series to get stuck into if you're in the mood for beautiful landscape visuals from the Arctic to the deep South."

Now and Forever is the 33rd album by Lettermen. It is a studio album produced by Ed Cobb, David D. Cavanaugh, and Jim Pike, and released in 1974 by Capitol Records. Now and Forever is the group's first album with original songs. For the release of the album, the group changed their name from "The Lettermen" to "Lettermen".
Two songs were released as singles; a medley of “Touch Me in the Morning/The Way We Were” which reached number 31 on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart and number 10 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary chart, and "Eastward" which reached #16 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.

Concept and development
After 13 years of success with covers and medleys of hit songs, the Lettermen sought new and original songs for their next album, in an effort not to appear as a cover band. Their manager, Jess Rand, and staffer Billy Delbert looked for new material. Included in the album are "Touch Me in the Morning", "Maria", and "Eres Tu", which reached No. 1 on the Cash Box charts in 1974.
In 1968, Bob Engemann of the Lettermen heard the Abilene Christian College group the ACCents, led by lead vocalist Bill Hughes, while they were on a tour of the Southeast United States. Engemann asked for a tape of their songs, which led to the recording of Eastward, for the Now and Forever album.

Critical reception
In a Cashbox album review, the album was called an "up to date collection" saying "given a super treatment by the trio", regarding it as "the best music around". In Billboard, Elliot Tiegel opined that the group's "distinct soft vocal blend" is its "calling card," remarking that the move to "contemporize its sound have not hurt its artistic ability."
Jack Burke wrote for La Crosse Tribune that the album and group are "always on target... and good songs, too." Bill E. Burk of the Memphis Press-Scimitar wrote that the Lettermen have "the easiest voices to listen to" and hearing the Now and Forever "brings on a surging desire to shut your eyes and let the words and the music just penetrate."

The Proteus Operation is a science fiction alternate history novel written by James P. Hogan. The plot focuses on an Anglo-American team of soldiers and civilians sent back in time from the Nazi-dominated world of 1975
to prevent an Axis victory in World War II that was engineered by more advanced time travelers from the 21st century. 
Historical figures in the book include Isaac Asimov, Wilhelm Canaris, Winston Churchill, Duff Cooper, Anthony Eden, Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Reinhard Heydrich, Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, John F. Kennedy, Frederick Lindemann, George Pegram, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Leo Szilard, and Edward Teller. Of these, only Asimov and Teller were still alive when the novel was published in 1985.

Plot
Originally, the First World War was a complete wake-up call for the human race, leading to greater internationalism and a "Never Again" spirit towards war that would eventually wear away the differences between the various power-blocs. By the 2020s, a global League of Nations oversees a planet totally at peace. The fledgling Nazi Party, in this 'original' timeline, simply faded out after the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch.
Many in the modern aristocracy, corporate dynasties, and others feel they have lost out because of the social transformations enabled by decades of peace and co-operation. This group comes up with a plan to build a functional "time machine" and change history for their benefit. Their scheme is to go back as far as they can (roughly a century, to the very early 1920s) and mentor the fledgling Nazi Party. They regard the Nazis as the perfect tool for destroying the Soviet Union and establishing an elitist tyranny with which they can live the lives of luxury and entitlement they believe have been stolen from them. This 'Uptime' initiative sends 21st century advisors, armament, and nuclear weapons to support Adolf Hitler.
The Hitler that they seek to advise soon develops other plans. Learning about the original history from his time traveling advisors, Hitler uses these lessons to ensure that Western Europe falls swiftly, followed by dropping a few of the Uptime nuclear weapons to wipe out the Soviet Union. He then destroys his end of the "time conduit" and declares independence from his former sponsors. By the 1970s, Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan have conquered everything other than North America, Australasia, and parts of South America. Africa has suffered an enormous genocide every bit as complete as the one inflicted upon the Jews, and the Axis powers stand poised in 1975 to start a final war that the United States is bound to lose, given the military power of Nazi Germany.
An organization in this altered 1975 discovers the secret behind the Nazi successes of the previous decades. The group decides that it will build its own time machine to go back and stop the present nightmare of Nazi world domination. This 1975 time machine is not as advanced or powerful as the original 2020s machine, so they can only open a gate to 1939. The plan is to establish a military alliance between the 1975 America of President John F. Kennedy and the 1939 America of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The team starts noticing that events they had no hand in are different (such as the Joe Louis versus John Henry Lewis fight and the death of Pope Pius XI) and with Einstein's help realize that all possible outcomes already exist and all time travel does is take you to one of these other branches.
Realizing why things have gone wrong, it is up to the 1975 Uptime agents, cut off in 1939, to keep the western Allies, including the United Kingdom and the United States in the fight, while working to close off Hitler's gateway to the alternate 2020s before he gets his atomic bomb and missile advantage.
In the end, they succeed, and this second "alternate timeline" they create turns out to be our own world.  They also realize that the United States of their own time knew they couldn't really change their present and was in reality planning to escape to the reality they would create just as the people backing Hitler had planned to do.  To prevent their United States or Nazi Germany from invading our world they have the gate destroyed.

James Cuthbert (June 4, 1769 – March 5, 1849) was a seigneur and political figure in Lower Canada.
He was born at Berthier in 1769, the son of seigneur James Cuthbert, and studied at the English College at Douai, France. He served in the 60th Regiment of the British Army, becoming lieutenant in 1797. Cuthbert inherited the seigneury of Berthier from his father in 1798. He was named justice of the peace for Trois-Rivières district in 1808. He served in the local militia, becoming lieutenant-colonel. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for Warwick in 1796 and served until 1811, when he was named to the Legislative Council. Cuthbert had run unsuccessfully for the same seat in the legislative assembly in 1792. At that time, he tried unsuccessfully to have the election of Pierre-Paul Margane de Lavaltrie overturned because Lavaltrie was not a British subject. In 1802, Cuthbert married Marie-Claire, the daughter of judge John Fraser. He married his cousin Mary-Louise-Amable Cairns in 1814. Cuthbert was named to the Special Council that governed the province after the Lower Canada Rebellion.
He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1822. During his life he owned 3 slaves in Canada.
He died at his manor at Berthier in 1849.
His son Edward Octavian became a member of the Canadian House of Commons. His brother Ross also represented Warwick in the legislative assembly.

Xanthe Terra is a large area on Mars, centered just north of the Martian equator. Its coordinates are 3°N 312°E and its diameter is  
1867.65 km. Its name means "golden-yellow land."  It is in the Lunae Palus quadrangle, the Coprates quadrangle,  the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle, and the Oxia Palus quadrangle.
Ravi Vallis, Aromatum Chaos, Ophir, Ganges Chasma, Nanedi Valles, Shalbatana Vallis, Orson Welles Crater, Mutch Crater, and  Da Vinci Crater are some major features in Xanthe Terra.
Images from Mars Express, Mars Global Surveyor, and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have revealed ancient river valleys and deltas. The deltas show many thin layers just as deltas on Earth. Scientists speculate that features in Xanthe Terra show evidence of precipitation on early Mars.

Departure of King Wilhelm I for the Army, July 31, 1870 is an oil on canvas painting by German artist Adolph Menzel, created in 1871.  It depicts a scene that takes place in the avenue Unter den Linden, in Berlin, where a crowd is paying tribute to King Wilhelm I of Prussia, as he passes in an open carriage, on his way to the Franco-Prussian War, who had started two weeks earlier. The painting is part of the collection of the Alte Nationalgalerie, in Berlin, since 1881.

History
In the summer of 1870, Menzel was on vacation in Switzerland, which he cut short after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. According to tradition, he was sitting in a restaurant on the first floor of the Linden in Berlin on July 31, 1870 and was thus able to witness the king's departure for the army. Menzel wrote that he did the painting with his left hand, as for example those from his series about Frederick II. Significantly, Menzel, originally left-handed, had learned the ability to work equally well with both hands. For reasons of lighting in the composition, he chose the right hand for the preliminary drawing and the left hand for the painterly part. Max Jordan assumed the painter's position to be on the south side of the Linden near the Russian Embassy, not far from the Brandenburg Gate. But the neo-baroque facades on the right do not match. This then-modern type of ornate architecture was under construction on Friedrichstrasse. At that time, a late-classical style prevailed on Unter den Linden. Elsewhere it is said that Menzel reported that “on July 31, 1870 he was on his way to the hairdresser’s when he suddenly saw the king’s carriage on Unter den Linden. The farewell waves and various shouts would have made it clear to him that Wilhelm was about to leave the capital in order to travel to the troops marching up on the Rhine."
Menzel made several sketches for this painting, which are in various museums. The title of the painting was initially Unter den Linden in Berlin in the afternoon of July 31, 1870 or The Linden in Berlin in the afternoon of July 31, 1870, which was used in the first exhibitions; later this title was dropped.

Description
In this painting, Menzel depicts the boulevard Unter den Linden, in Berlin, in a strongly perspective composition. A huge crowd cheers the Prussian King Wilhelm I, who is sitting next to his wife in a carriage and is heading towards the Brandenburg Gate to reach the Berlin Potsdamer Bahnhof. Wilhelm traveled to the theater of war as commander-in-chief of the armies of the North German Confederation and the southern German states, whose deployment across the Rhine was almost complete. The Berlin Palace is in the background of the painting, but the other royal buildings, such as the royal operas don't appear at all. The tower of the recently completed Red Town Hall, on the other hand, is painted more clearly, which points to the increasing importance of the bourgeoisie after the war had been won (Menzel completed the painting in 1871 after the war). Both the shadowy castle and the town hall are the only buildings that can be clearly identified. The bourgeois facades on the right edge of the picture, on the other hand, are fictitious and appear oversized in their almost vertical perspective cornice line due to the strong view from below. With her neo-baroque decorations, it could be a depiction of an in the foreground; these building facades represent the prosperity of the self-celebrating bourgeoisie in a time of economic upswing.
Apparently, a strong gust of wind is blowing through the street, swirling the patriotic flag decorations. The flags on Linden-Boulevard present not only the intertwined federal flags but also the black and white Prussian flags, but these are hardly swirled. A special feature is the easily recognizable flag of the Red Cross, which is located almost in the vanishing point of the painting. Here Menzel refers to the victims of wars, which were always important to him. Some of his drawings and watercolors deal with them.
Amidst the crowd's obedient homage, cheers and cheering gestures, the monarch's white-lined carriage provides a stark contrast that draws the viewer's attention. The king salutes with his right hand on his spiked helmet, while in the real scene he was wearing a simple "traveller's hat"; his wife Augusta fights back the tears and holds a handkerchief in front of her face. Some figures turn away from the king and are busy with other things, some are clearly identifiable. The buyer of the painting, the banker and friend of Menzel, Magnus Herrmann, is said to be on the back balcony with his wife. Herrmann's daughter Clara and her husband, the painter Albert Hertel, can also be seen in the front right. The man in the foreground, who has his back turned to the events, wears a conspicuously light-colored hat and appears to be drawing something on a piece of paper, he is believed by the historian Susanne Drexler to be a self-portrait of Menzel. Menzel's historical paintings often contain a humorous, genre-like component. In this case, it is the newsboy who is baring his teeth at the dog.

This is about the 2001 game for Game Boy Advance. For the series, see Fire Pro Wrestling.

Fire Pro Wrestling (released in Japan as Fire Pro Wrestling A (ファイヤープロレスリング A, Faiyā Puro Resuringu A)) is a professional wrestling video game in the Fire Pro Wrestling series and was the first Fire Pro game to receive an official English translation and the first to be released on a portable system rather than a console. A direct sequel, Fire Pro Wrestling 2, was released in 2002.

Gameplay
As with other games in the series, Fire Pro Wrestling is not licensed by any major professional wrestling promotions, instead using likenesses of existing wrestlers with fake names; for an example, the wrestler The Bionic Man Steve Majors is a fictionalized version of the WWE wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin, or The Wraith Mystery Man being a fictionalized version of (at the time) World Championship Wrestling wrestler Rey Mysterio. As with Fire Pro games, MMA is featured in the game and federations like Pride and the Ultimate Fighting Championship feature with fighters. The game features over a hundred different characters.
Fire Pro Wrestling makes the player play with strategy. The games use the A and B buttons for striking and grappling. 
The game features a variety of different modes, such as tournaments and leagues that task the player with winning bracket-style competitions against up to 15 and 63 opponents, respectively. There is also exhibition modes, allowing player to tweak rules and music, and also a robust create-a-wrestler mode, which allows players to build a character from more than 1,200 different techniques and hundreds of body parts. Most unique to Fire Pro Wrestling is the game's audience mode, where your goal is not necessarily to win, but to please the crowd by breaking out of pinfall attempts at the last second, defeating opponents after a finisher, or taunting your opponent. Sucsuss frequently depends on which league you align yourself with; for an example, the luchador-styled league will gain greater audience reception from performing high-flying, more athletic moves.

Release
The game was a launch title for the Game Boy Advance for Japan.

Reception
The game received "favorable" reviews, earning an average score of 80 based on 10 critic reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.
Reviewing the game for GameSpot, Gerald Villoria spoke positively of the game, describing it as having "made the transition from Japan to the USA extremely well", praising its 'create a wrestler' system and describing the controls as "absolutely flawless". He also praised the game for its wide variety of modes, particularly its audience match mode.
However, NextGen gave a more mixed review to the game, saying that the game's difficulty would make it inaccessible for the novices. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 27 out of 40. Bad Hare of GamePro said, "fans would be wise to cut Fire Pro Wrestling some slack in the name of depth. If you like old-school smackdowns, get in the ring!" Nintendo Power was far more critical of the title, noting it as having "choppy animation and sluggish controls", and specifically criticized the graphics, describing them as "graphically underwhelming" and negatively describing the game "looks and feels like it should be for the GBC rather than the GBA".

In an interview with The Daily Beast, Cruz stated he witnessed someone shot in front of him when he was 12 years old, noting that "his brains came out the back of his head." For his portrayal of Tuco Salamanca, he was able to relate to his experiences witnessing people who were high on meth.
Cruz has said that becoming interested in American literature early in life helped him avoid joining such gangs himself.  His favorite novel is Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Cruz attended 3 high schools after being expelled for writing editorials on the newspaper that caused him to be late to class as well as being considered inappropriate. He attended East Los Angeles College.

He played a Los Angeles firefighter in Collateral Damage. He had guest roles in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode "The Siege of AR-558", The X-Files episode "El Mundo Gira", and the second season of 24. He also made an appearance as the father of a murdered girl in CSI. He played Det Julio Sanchez for the entire seven season run of The Closer and continued in that role for all six seasons of the spin-off Major Crimes. 
Cruz performed the well-known role of Tuco Salamanca, a sadistic and psychotic meth dealer in Breaking Bad in 2008 and 2009, a role he reprised in 2015-16 during the first two seasons of the Breaking Bad prequel spin-off, Better Call Saul. 
He had a recurring role as Paco on My Name Is Earl, and as Alejandro Perez on Nip/Tuck.

Personal life

Recover, Vol. 1 is an extended play by Amy Lee, released on February 19, 2016. It features four cover songs performed by Lee.

Background
During a radio interview in July 2015, Lee said that she had been recording cover songs and expressed an interest in releasing them online. On October 27, 2015, she released the first song from the collection with Portishead's 1994 song "It's A Fire", followed by U2's 1987 song "With or Without You" on November 10, 2015, Led Zeppelin's 1971 song "Going to California" on December 1, 2015, and Chris Isaak's 1996 song "Baby Did a Bad, Bad Thing" on December 15, 2015. They are compiled on Recover, Vol. 1. The cover songs are accompanied by music videos directed by Eric Ryan Anderson. Lee released a statement about the EP on her official Facebook profile, writing,

"Making these covers has been a really satisfying outlet for me lately. I get to play with music I already love and know so well, and instead of just singing my own parts over the speakers (like I've done for years with some of these!), I’m getting inside it. You asked for it, so I'm putting the first 4 on an EP for sale on iTunes."

Memoirs
On an edition of Public Radio International's arts and culture series Studio 360 broadcast on May 30, 2008, Ellison announced that he had signed with a "major publisher" to produce his memoirs, under the tentative title Working Without a Net. That title first appeared  in the television show Babylon 5, for which Ellison was a creative consultant: in the episode "TKO" (originally broadcast in 1994), the fictional character Susan Ivanova is seen reading and laughing at a book entitled Working Without a Net by Harlan Ellison in 2258. Ultimately, Ellison chose author Nat Segaloff to write his biography and sat down for several hours of interviews, with the understanding that Ellison would have no veto over what would be in the book. That book, A Lit Fuse: The Provocative Life of Harlan Ellison, was published on July 14, 2017, by NESFA Press.

Mettray Penal Colony, situated in the small village of Mettray, in the French département of Indre-et-Loire, just north of the city of Tours, was a private reformatory, without walls, opened in 1840 for the rehabilitation of young male delinquents aged between 6 and 21.  At that time, children and adolescents were normally imprisoned together with adults.  Aspects of the progressive way in which the Colony was organized anticipated the English borstal system established at the beginning of the 20th century.

History
Frédéric-Auguste Demetz (1796–1873), a penal reformer and lawyer at the French Royal Court, together with the architect Guillaume-Abel Blouet (1795–1853), toured the United States together in 1836 to study American prison architecture and administration for the French government. Today Blouet is probably best known as the architect who completed the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Upon Blouet's return to Paris he devoted himself to the reform of prison design and in 1838 was appointed Inspector General of French Prisons. Blouet believed in using architecture to realize social reform and together with Demetz worked on the design and layout of the buildings for the Colony which was initially directed by Demetz after its opening in July 1839. It was noted as being officially opened on 22 January 1840.

Layout
The layout of the Colony was characterised by a sense of order and community. From the entrance to the Colony a large central square, dominated symbolically by a chapel on one side, lies at the end of a long tree-lined avenue. The entrance to the square has the director's house on one side and the preparatory school, where the instructors were trained, on the other. Ten identical, three-storey pavilions are arranged on the two sides of the square. These were referred to as houses and were the places where the boys lived and worked.  There were workshops on the ground floor where the boys who did not work in the fields learnt a trade. The first floor functioned as a dormitory at night, with the boys sleeping in hammocks, and as a refectory during the day time. The second floor contained a separate dormitory for the younger children.
Each house was occupied by a family of 40 boys under the supervision of a young man (chef de famille) and his assistant (sous chef) specially chosen by Demetz and trained at the Colony's own preparatory school. The Colony was deliberately organised to imitate the structure of a family because it was felt that the failure of the boys' biological families was the reason for them to be sent to Mettray. Besides the pavilions there were flower gardens, accommodation for visitors, stables, a farm with animals and extensive cultivated fields, and a quarry. A replica of a sailing ship, complete with masts and rigging, was set in the square and used for training boys, many of whom would enter the navy on leaving Mettray. There were around 400 inmates in total and the Colony was largely self-sufficient.

Formative years
Demetz believed in the healing properties of nature and his motto was ameliorer l'homme par la terre et la terre par l'homme, sous le regard de Dieu which translated means improve man by the land and the land by man, under the watch of God. The Colony's mission was to reform, through manual agricultural work and through prayer, the young inmates; many of whom had already been corrupted by their stay in traditional prisons.  At first the Colony thrived and Demetz's work attracted favorable notice in England, and following the passage of the first Youthful Offenders Act (1854), which greatly stimulated the building of reform and industrial schools, he became the hero of the British philanthropic world.  A number of similar penal colonies, modelled on Mettray, were established in other countries including Poland, the Nederlandsche Mettray (by William Suringar) in the Netherlands and the Philanthropic Society's Farm School for Boys at Redhill, Surrey, in England.
The boys had their heads shaved, wore uniforms, and up to the age of 12 spent most of the day studying arithmetic, writing and reading. The older boys had just one hour of classes and the rest of the day was spent working. Some were employed in trades, or in the orchards and vineyards, but the majority performed hard agricultural labour including digging and crushing stones for roads. The work was hard, the food mediocre and any misdeeds were severely punished.  This discipline could not, however, prevent the vices encouraged by the overcrowded conditions in which the boys lived.
Apart from the reformatory for boys who were mostly deprived, disadvantaged or abandoned children, many of whom had committed only petty crimes, there was a separate institution, the Maison Paternelle, where wealthy families paid to have their wayward children looked after. The writer Jules Verne sent his son Michel to Mettray for a period of 6 months in 1876.

Decline
In his book The Miracle of the Rose (1946), the French writer Jean Genet described his experience of nearly three years of detention in the Colony (between 2 September 1926 and 1 March 1929) which ended when he joined the Foreign Legion at age 18. In the 1920s Mettray was no longer the radical liberal institution run by Demetz, who had died in 1873, and was now widely criticized for its harsh discipline.
This criticism, combined with financial problems, led to the Colony's closure in 1937, by which time more than 17,000 boys had passed its doors, and it had become the most well-known institution of its kind.

Mettray in Discipline and Punish
Mettray Penal colony has become more than just a model prison for boys in the work of Michel Foucault. In Discipline and Punish Foucault denotes the opening of Mettray prison as the most significant change in the modern status of prisons. He writes: "Were I to fix the date of completion of the carceral system... [t]he date I would choose would be 22 January 1840, the date of the official opening of Mettray. Or better still, perhaps, that glorious day, unremarked and unrecorded, when a child in Mettray remarked as he lay dying: 'What a pity I left the colony so soon'." Mettray became the focal point for Foucault because of the various systems and expressions of power which it exhibited, something which became very important for the investigations of Michel Foucault in his works. The precursors to his works can be seen in the structures inherent in Mettray. Despite its relatively unremarkable place in penal lore, this notation by Foucault sets Mettray apart from many other prisons. For if Foucault is to be believed, it was at this French penal colony where began our descent into modern penal theories and the inherent power structures they entail.
