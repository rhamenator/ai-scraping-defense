# *Testing with Kali Linux:* Leverage the tools it comes with to make sure this stack is secure

## You can use Kali Linux’s toolset to check your own systems for common vulnerabilities and to verify that your defenses are working properly. Below is an outline of common defensive steps:

### 1. *Discover and Inventory*
 - *Nmap or Masscan* can identify live hosts and open ports on your network. Use them to build a list of devices and services.
 - *Netdiscover or arp-scan* can help map out your local network by identifying devices via ARP.

### 2. *Identify Vulnerabilities*
 - *OpenVAS (or its fork Greenbone Vulnerability Management)* can run automated vulnerability scans. Configure it with your network subnets and review the reports for high/critical findings.
 - *Nikto* checks web servers for common issues (outdated software, misconfigurations).

### 3. *Test Services Manually*
 - *Metasploit* provides a framework for testing exploitation of known vulnerabilities (set your targets to hosts you own). Try non-destructive modules or use it with safe payloads to confirm patch levels.
 - *Enum4linux* can enumerate shares and other information from SMB services, useful for Windows hosts.

### 4. *Audit Passwords and Configs*
 - *Hydra or Medusa* can run brute-force password tests, but be cautious—they’re resource intensive and easily misused. Consider them only on your own systems or with explicit permission.
 - *Review configuration files, firewall rules, and other security settings*. Tools like *Lynis* audit Linux system security.

### 5. *Monitor & Log*
 - Set up or review logging and monitoring. Kali includes packages for OSSEC or you can install *Suricata/Snort* for network-based intrusion detection.
 - Use *GoAccess* or similar log analysis tools to check web logs for suspicious patterns.

### 6. *Stay Organized*
 - Keep notes or a playbook for your assessment steps, findings, and remediation actions.
 - After scanning, patch or disable insecure services, then rescan to ensure issues are resolved.

### 7. *Use Caution and Consider Impact*
 - Even on your own network, intensive scans or exploitation attempts can affect system performance or disrupt services. Test in off-hours or on a staging environment when possible.
 - Some tools (e.g., password crackers or aggressive exploit modules) can be risky. Run them only when needed and with proper safeguards.

## Summary
Always ensure you have explicit authorization for the systems you test. By methodically using Kali’s built-in tools to discover, scan, and analyze your own environment, you’ll gain better visibility into potential weaknesses and can remediate them before an attacker finds them.
