# GitHub Actions Runner Deployment

The repository provides a minimal workflow that demonstrates how a deployment step can run entirely in GitHub Actions. The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and can be triggered manually from the **Actions** tab.

When executed, the job checks out the repository, creates a small deployment artifact, and uploads it to the workflow run. This keeps everything self-contained on the GitHub runner so you can experiment safely with environments and approvals.

This example is a starting point for building a full deployment pipeline. You can adapt the workflow to push Docker images or apply Kubernetes manifests once you have the necessary credentials.
