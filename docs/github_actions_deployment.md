# GitHub Actions Runner Deployment

The repository provides several workflows that demonstrate how a deployment step
can run entirely in GitHub Actions. The simplest example is located at
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and can be triggered manually from the **Actions**
tab. When executed, the job checks out the repository, creates a small
deployment artifact, and uploads it to the workflow run.

For a full-stack test, the `iis-deploy.yml` workflow spins up the Windows-based
IIS configuration using the `quick_iis.ps1` helper script. On Linux runners, the
`linux-stack.yml` workflow builds and launches the Docker Compose stack so the
entire system comes online automatically. These pipelines serve as starting
pointsâ€”you can extend them to push Docker images or apply Kubernetes manifests
once you have the necessary credentials.
