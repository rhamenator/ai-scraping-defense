# System Architecture

The AI Scraping Defense system is designed as a distributed, microservice-based architecture. This design promotes scalability, resilience, and separation of concerns. The system is composed of several key components orchestrated by Docker Compose for local development and Kubernetes for production.

## Core Components

- **Nginx Proxy:** The public-facing entry point for all traffic. It uses Lua scripting for high-performance initial request filtering, such as checking against a blocklist in Redis. Suspicious requests are asynchronously forwarded to the AI Service for deeper analysis.
- **Traefik Router:** Provides internal load balancing for the optional local LLM containers. The Docker provider automatically discovers containers with Traefik labels, and the `llama3` and `mixtral` services assign routing rules and weights to distribute traffic.
- **Prompt Router:** Routes LLM requests from the Escalation Engine to either a local model or the cloud proxy based on prompt size.

- **Python Services:** A collection of specialized microservices that form the "brain" of the system. All Python services are built from a single, unified `Dockerfile` to ensure consistency and reduce build times.

  - **AI Service:** A simple webhook that receives suspicious request data from Nginx and queues it for analysis by the Escalation Engine.
  - **Escalation Engine:** The central analysis component. It runs a multi-stage pipeline to score requests, using heuristics, a machine learning model, and optionally a powerful LLM for a final verdict.
  - **Tarpit API:** Provides a set of "tarpits" (e.g., zip bombs, slow responses, nonsensical data) designed to waste the resources of confirmed malicious bots.
  - **Admin UI:** A FastAPI-based web interface for monitoring system metrics and viewing the blocklist. Configuration is loaded from environment variables, though a couple of runtime-only options (log level and escalation endpoint) can be tweaked via the interface.
  - **Cloud Dashboard:** Centralized service that aggregates metrics from multiple installations for hosted monitoring.
  - **Config Recommender:** Analyzes traffic patterns to suggest firewall and tarpit tuning parameters.
  - **Blocklist Sync Daemon:** Periodically pulls updates from the public community blocklist.
  - **Peer Sync Daemon:** Exchanges blocklisted IPs with other deployments.
  - **Adaptive Rate Limit Daemon:** Adjusts Nginx rate limit rules based on observed traffic.
  - **Public Community Blocklist Service:** Hosts a shared IP reputation list that contributors can update via a simple API.

- **Data Stores:**
  - **Redis:** An in-memory data store used for high-speed operations like caching, managing the IP blocklist, and tracking request frequencies.
  - **PostgreSQL:** A relational database used for storing the persistent data needed for the Markov chain text generator.

- **Background Jobs:**
  - **Corpus Updater & Markov Trainer:** Cron jobs that periodically fetch new text data and retrain the Markov model to keep the tarpit content fresh.
  - **Archive Rotator:** A simple service that manages the "zip bomb" archives used by the Tarpit API.
  - **Blocklist Sync Daemon:** Periodically pulls IP reputation data from the Public Community Blocklist Service.
  - **Peer Sync Daemon:** Shares blocklisted IPs between trusted deployments.
  - **Adaptive Rate Limit Daemon:** Updates Nginx rate-limit settings based on recent traffic patterns.

## Optional Cloud Integrations

The stack can integrate with external services for enhanced protection. Each integration is controlled via environment variables and is disabled by default:

- **Global CDN (`ENABLE_GLOBAL_CDN`)** – Connects to a a major CDN provider for worldwide edge caching.
- **DDoS Mitigation (`ENABLE_DDOS_PROTECTION`)** – The `ddos_guard.py` tool watches access logs for flooding patterns, categorizes them as HTTP floods or volumetric attacks, and submits offenders to the local escalation engine. Requests can also be forwarded to an external provider when configured.
- **Managed TLS (`ENABLE_MANAGED_TLS`)** – Automatically requests and renews TLS certificates.
- **Web Application Firewall (`ENABLE_WAF`)** – Applies additional request filtering using customizable rules.

These features are optional so deployments remain lightweight when cloud services are unavailable.

## Local IP Banning with Fail2ban

Fail2ban monitors the shared Nginx logs and inserts firewall rules using
`iptables` or `nftables` when an IP is blocked by the Lua script. The log line
`check_blocklist: Blocking IP <ip>` triggers a temporary ban matching the Redis
blocklist TTL.

### Activation Steps

1. **Docker Compose** – Ensure the `fail2ban` service is enabled and start it
   alongside the other containers:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d fail2ban
   ```
2. **Kubernetes** – Apply `nginx-logs-pvc.yaml`, update the `nginx-deployment`
   to mount this volume, then deploy `fail2ban-deployment.yaml`.

Fail2ban runs with `NET_ADMIN` and `NET_RAW` capabilities so it can modify host
firewall rules. Review these permissions and adjust `bantime` and `findtime`
within the jail to fit your security policy.

## Suricata Network IDS

The optional `suricata` service captures network traffic and writes EVE JSON
logs to `/var/log/suricata/eve.json`. Alerts are forwarded to the Escalation
Engine by `src/util/suricata_manager.py`.

### Activation Steps

1. **Docker Compose** – Start the service alongside the stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d suricata
   ```
2. **Kubernetes** – Deploy `suricata-deployment.yaml` in the `ai-defense`
   namespace.
