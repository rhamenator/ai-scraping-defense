# Cybersecurity and FOSS Partnerships

The project aims to collaborate with external cybersecurity groups and open-source communities. These partnerships can share threat intelligence and improve detection accuracy.

## Potential Integration Points

- **Threat Feed API** – Periodic pull of malicious IPs or behavioral signatures from trusted partners.
- **Alert Webhooks** – Receive real-time notifications about emerging scraping campaigns or exploits.
- **Community Submissions** – Allow peers to contribute suspicious traffic patterns for collective analysis.
- **Federated Blocklists** – Exchange blocklist entries with other deployments to strengthen defenses.

Each integration point can be enabled or disabled via environment variables in `sample.env`.
