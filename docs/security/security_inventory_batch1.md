# Security Inventory â€“ Batch 1

This report inventories findings from `security_problems_batch1.json`
with scope limited to `src/`, `scripts/`, `nginx/`, and `docker-compose.yaml`.
Findings are prioritized by exploitability, emphasizing secrets, transport
security, and authentication/authorization weaknesses.

## Prioritization Summary

- **Critical (Secrets):** 5 findings
- **High (Transport Security):** 2 findings
- **High (Authentication/Authorization):** 2 findings
- **Medium (General Hardening):** 8 findings

## Detailed Findings

| Priority | ID | Area | Problem | Key Files | Recommended Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Critical (Secrets) | 1 | scripts | Hardcoded Default Credentials | scripts/linux/generate_secrets.sh<br/>scripts/windows/Generate-Secrets.ps1 | Replace all default passwords and API keys with securely generated values. Implement proper secret management with HashiCorp Vault or cloud-native secret managers. Add secret rotation policies and never commit secrets to version control. |
| Critical (Secrets) | 4 | scripts | Weak Secret Management | scripts/linux/generate_secrets.sh<br/>scripts/windows/Generate-Secrets.ps1 | Implement secure secret generation that never outputs secrets to console or logs. Use proper secret management tools and implement proper key rotation mechanisms with encryption at rest. |
| Critical (Secrets) | 6 | src | Insufficient Access Controls | src/admin_ui/admin_ui.py<br/>src/ai_service/main.py | Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with proper authorization checks on all endpoints. Add JWT token validation and implement proper session management. |
| Critical (Secrets) | 9 | src | Vulnerable Session Management | src/admin_ui/auth.py | Implement secure session tokens with proper expiration, add session invalidation on logout, implement concurrent session limits, and use secure cookie attributes. |
| Critical (Secrets) | 23 | src | Missing API Authentication | src/ai_service/main.py | Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT authentication, add API key management, create authentication middleware, and implement authentication monitoring. |
| High (Transport Security) | 7 | docker-compose, nginx | Missing HTTPS Enforcement | docker-compose.yaml<br/>nginx/nginx.conf | Enforce HTTPS for all communications, implement HSTS headers, add certificate management, and redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS with proper SSL/TLS configuration. |
| High (Transport Security) | 10 | nginx, src | Missing Security Headers | nginx/nginx.conf<br/>src/admin_ui/admin_ui.py | Implement comprehensive security headers including X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, CSP, and HSTS with proper configuration. |
| High (Authentication/Authorization) | 24 | src | Inadequate Authorization | src/admin_ui/ | Implement role-based access control, add attribute-based access control, create authorization policies, and implement authorization testing. |
| High (Authentication/Authorization) | 35 | src | Missing Multi-Factor Authentication | src/admin_ui/auth.py | Implement TOTP-based MFA, add backup codes, create MFA recovery procedures, and implement adaptive authentication based on risk assessment. |
| Medium (General Hardening) | 2 | docker-compose | Insecure Docker Configuration | docker-compose.yaml | Configure containers to run as non-root users, implement read-only filesystems, drop unnecessary capabilities, and add security scanning to CI/CD pipeline. Use distroless base images and implement proper resource limits. |
| Medium (General Hardening) | 3 | src | Missing Input Validation | src/ai_service/main.py<br/>src/escalation/escalation_engine.py<br/>src/tarpit/tarpit_api.py | Implement comprehensive input validation using Pydantic models, add request schema validation, sanitize all user inputs, and implement proper error handling for validation failures. |
| Medium (General Hardening) | 5 | src | SQL Injection Vulnerabilities | src/tarpit/markov_generator.py | Replace all string concatenation in SQL queries with parameterized queries. Implement ORM usage with automatic escaping and add SQL injection testing to security pipeline. |
| Medium (General Hardening) | 8 | src | Insecure CORS Policies | src/admin_ui/admin_ui.py | Implement restrictive CORS policies with explicit origin whitelisting, remove wildcard origins in production, and add proper preflight request handling. |
| Medium (General Hardening) | 11 | src | Insecure File Upload Handling | src/admin_ui/ | Implement file type validation, add virus scanning, create upload size limits, and implement secure file storage with access controls. |
| Medium (General Hardening) | 14 | src | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | src/shared/http_client.py | Implement URL validation and whitelisting, add network segmentation, create request filtering, and implement SSRF protection middleware. |
| Medium (General Hardening) | 16 | src | Missing Rate Limiting on APIs | src/ai_service/main.py | Implement per-endpoint rate limiting, add user-based quotas, create rate limiting bypass for trusted sources, and implement rate limiting analytics. |
| Medium (General Hardening) | 37 | src | Missing Audit Logging | src/shared/audit.py | Implement comprehensive audit logging, add log integrity protection, create audit log analysis, and implement compliance reporting. |
