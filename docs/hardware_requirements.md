# Hardware Recommendations

Running the entire AI Scraping Defense stack along with the optional test website can use significant resources. For a smooth experience on a single machine we suggest:

- **CPU:** 4 cores or more
- **Memory:** At least 8&nbsp;GB of RAM
- **Storage:** 10&nbsp;GB of free disk space

These are approximate values for local experimentation on Ubuntu Server. Enabling optional services or collecting large datasets may require additional resources. Use at your own risk.
