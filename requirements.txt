# AI-SCRAPING-DEFENSE REQUIREMENTS
#
# This file lists the Python packages needed to run the project.
# It is organized by function for clarity.
#
# Versioning Strategy:
# We use the compatible release operator (~=) to ensure stable builds.
# For example, "fastapi~=0.115" will install the latest 0.115.x version
# but will not upgrade to 0.116.0, protecting against breaking changes.
