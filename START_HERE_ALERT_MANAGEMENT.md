# 🚀 START HERE: Alert Management System

**Welcome!** This document is your entry point to the Alert Management System. Read this first, then follow the links for more details.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Your repository has:
- ❌ Duplicate security alerts (same problem, different files)
- ❌ Duplicate issues (same topic, slightly different wording)
- ❌ Duplicate PRs (same fix, multiple attempts)
- ❌ Error-state alerts (failed scans, need diagnosis)
- ❌ Growing clutter that makes real issues hard to find

## What This System Does

✅ **Finds Duplicates** - Smart content-based detection  
✅ **Consolidates Items** - Keeps one, closes rest with notes  
✅ **Diagnoses Errors** - Identifies issues and suggests fixes  
✅ **Generates Reports** - Complete audit trail of actions  
✅ **Safe by Default** - Dry-run mode to preview changes  

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Requirements (30 seconds)

```bash
pip install requests PyGithub
```

### Step 2: Set Your Token (30 seconds)

Create a GitHub token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

Check these boxes:
- ☑ repo
- ☑ security_events  
- ☑ admin:org

Then:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

### Step 3: Run It! (1 minute)

```bash
./scripts/run_alert_management.sh
```

That's it! The script will:
1. ✓ Check prerequisites
2. ✓ Fetch all alerts, issues, PRs
3. ✓ Identify duplicates
4. ✓ Show you what it would do (DRY RUN - no changes)
5. ✓ Generate a report

Review the output. If you like what you see:

```bash
./scripts/run_alert_management.sh --live
```

## Example Output

```

## What Makes It Smart?

### Not Just File-Based
❌ **Wrong**: "Same file path = duplicate"  
✅ **Right**: "Same problem type + 80% similar content = duplicate"

### Example
These ARE duplicates (will be consolidated):
```
Alert #1: "B104: hardcoded_bind_all_interfaces in src/file1.py"
Alert #2: "B104: hardcoded_bind_all_interfaces in src/file2.py"
```

These are NOT duplicates (will be kept separate):
```
Alert #1: "B104: hardcoded_bind_all_interfaces"
Alert #2: "B110: try_except_pass"
```

## Safety Features

🛡️ **Dry-Run Mode** - Test without making changes  
🛡️ **Detailed Logging** - See exactly what will happen  
🛡️ **Comprehensive Reports** - Full audit trail  
🛡️ **Superseding Notes** - All closures reference primary item  
🛡️ **Graceful Errors** - Handles API failures without crashing

## Three Ways to Run

### 1. Helper Script (Easiest)
```bash
./scripts/run_alert_management.sh
```
- ✓ Checks prerequisites
- ✓ Colored output
- ✓ Confirms before changes
- ✓ Best for manual runs

### 2. Direct Python (Most Control)
```bash
python scripts/manage_alerts_issues_prs.py \
  --owner rhamenator \
  --repo ai-scraping-defense \
  --dry-run
```
- ✓ Full control over options
- ✓ Best for scripting
- ✓ Easier to customize

### 3. GitHub Actions (Automated)
Go to Actions tab → "Manage Security Alerts and Issues" → Run workflow
- ✓ Runs automatically (weekly)
- ✓ No local setup needed
- ✓ Report saved as artifact
- ✓ Best for regular maintenance

## What Gets Managed?

### Security Alerts
- **Code Scanning**: Codacy, CodeQL, etc.
- **Secret Scanning**: Tokens, credentials
- **Dependabot**: Vulnerable dependencies

### Issues
- Duplicate detection by title/content
- Consolidation with superseding notes

### Pull Requests
- Duplicate detection by title/content
- Consolidation with references

## Common Questions

### Q: Will this delete my items?
**A:** No! It closes them with proper states and adds notes. You can reopen anything.

### Q: How do I know what will be consolidated?
**A:** Run with `--dry-run` first. It shows everything without making changes.

### Q: What if I disagree with a consolidation?
**A:** Reopen the closed item. It won't be re-closed unless it matches again.

### Q: Is my token safe?
**A:** Yes. It's never logged or displayed. Use environment variable for security.

### Q: How often should I run this?
**A:** Weekly for active repos, or after security scans. Start with monthly dry-runs.
