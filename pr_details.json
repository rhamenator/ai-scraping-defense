{"body":"\n## Automated Fix\n**Problem**: Missing Flyweight Pattern\n**Category**: Architecture\n**Severity**: Medium\n**Confidence**: 0.80 (High Confidence)\n\n### Explanation\nImplemented the Flyweight pattern in `src/tarpit/labyrinth.py` to optimize memory usage when generating labyrinth pages. The previous implementation created new `a` tag strings for each link, which can be memory-intensive when generating many pages or pages with a high depth. The Flyweight pattern addresses this by sharing the intrinsic state (the static parts of the `a` tag) among multiple objects, while the extrinsic state (the specific link) is passed as a parameter.  A shared `a` tag flyweight is created and reused for each link, significantly reducing memory overhead.\n\n### Verification\nAuto-generated fix. Please review carefully.\n\nFixes #635\n","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOOcDGis8AAAACKXH-aQ","name":"tarpit","description":"","color":"ededed"},{"id":"LA_kwDOOcDGis8AAAACQQRcKA","name":"Medium","description":"","color":"fbca04"},{"id":"LA_kwDOOcDGis8AAAACQQRcWg","name":"High Confidence","description":"","color":"0e8a16"},{"id":"LA_kwDOOcDGis8AAAACQQRclg","name":"automated-pr","description":"","color":"ededed"},{"id":"LA_kwDOOcDGis8AAAACQQd4OA","name":"Architecture","description":"","color":"1d76db"}],"title":"[Architecture] [Medium] Missing Flyweight Pattern"}
